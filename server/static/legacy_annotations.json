      "Who has a wine-identity? Consumption practices between distinction and democratization"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The relevance of consumer goods and consumer behaviour for the constitution and confirmation of a self-concept is widely acknowledged in consumer studies. However, in light of discussions in sociological theory, there is a question whether this is a selfconcept planed individually and connected to feelings of anxiety, as analysts of the contemporary society like Baumann, Beck and Giddens would have it, or whether consumption in the end is still bound to social identities grounded in belonging to social categories or socio-economic position. The question is empirically tested in this essay using the example of wine consumption and the relevance of such consumption for constructing a self-concept. The empirical analysis indicates first, that only a small group of consumers with high involvement in wine consumption considers wine relevant for their identity, and second, that both the construction of a wine-related consumer identity, as well as the feelings of insecurity and embarrassment associated with it are not directly influenced by socio-structural factors. Instead, in the case of wine consumption, these are transmitted through lifestyles and social networks."

      "Improving personal happiness through couple intervention: A randomized controlled trial of a self-directed couple enhancement program"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Although personal happiness is highly associated with social relationships, basic questions remain regarding the causal effect of improved social relationships on happiness. The main aim of this study was to test whether emotional and cognitive dimensions of personal happiness can be increased by means of a self-directed relationship enhancement program, which aims to increase relationship-relevant skills such as dyadic coping, communication, and conflict resolution. N = 220 couples were randomly assigned either to an intervention or to a waiting list control group (survey: pre-, post-, 3- and 6-month follow-ups). Multi-group latent change score models reveal that (1) personal happiness can be increased through a couple intervention; (2) change in personal happiness was predicted by an increase in skills and relationship satisfaction through the intervention; (3) the least happy participants benefited most from the intervention. Improving spousal interactions may help people become and stay happier. Participants in this study did not relapse to their set point of personal happiness as could be expected by adaptation theory. Thus, not treating individuals directly, but rather the dynamic system of spousal interactions as a whole, offers a potentially very powerful area for happiness research."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Currently, there is strong evidence showing that musicianship favours functional and structural changes of the left planum temporale (PT), and that these cortical reorganizations facilitate the discrimination of temporal speech cues. Based on the proposition of a division of labour between the left and right PT, here we postulated that the musicians\u2019 advantage in processing temporal speech cues and PT specialization origin, at least in part, from increased white matter connectivity between the two auditory-related cortices. In particular, we assume that increased transcallosal PT connectivity might promote functional specialization and asymmetry of homotopic brain regions. With this purpose in mind, we applied diffusion tensor imaging and compared axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the interhemispheric connection between the left and right PT in thirteen musicians and 13 nonmusicians. Furthermore, in the form of an addendum, we integrated cortical surface area values and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses of the left PT that were collected in the context of two previous studies conducted with the same sample of subjects. Our results indicate increased connectivity between the left and right PT in musicians compared to nonmusicians, as indexed by reduced mean RD. We did not find significant between-group differences in FA and AD. Most notably, RD was related to the performance in the phonetic categorization task, musical aptitudes, as well as to BOLD responses in the left PT. Hence, we provide first evidence for a relationship between PT connectivity, musicianship, and phonetic categorization."

    "description": [
      "The present study was designed to examine the relationships between students\u2019 character strengths, school-related affect, positive school functioning (i.e., motivation to learn, interest, and engagement at class), and school achievement following the \u201cengine model of well-being\u201d that is focusing on inputs (e.g., personality traits), processes (e.g., moods, emotions), and outcomes (e.g., engagement, accomplishments) within the context of well-being research. A sample of 196 children completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth, which assesses 24 character strengths, and the PANAS-C that assesses school-related positive and negative affect. Additionally, homeroom teachers rated students\u2019 positive school functioning (i.e., motivation, engagement, and interest at school) and their overall school achievement. The character strengths of zest, love of learning, perseverance, and social intelligence showed the strongest positive correlations with school-related positive affect. Teamwork, hope, self-regulation, and love were substantially negatively correlated with school-related negative affect. Certain character strengths showed positive relationships with positive school functioning and overall school achievement. A path model, testing the \u201cengine model of well-being\u201d, found\u2014additionally to direct effects\u2014indirect relationships between character strengths and positive school functioning (through school-related positive affect), which in turn leads to higher school achievement. The presented findings show character strengths as meaningful resources in the schooling context. Character strengths emerge to be crucial for students to experience school-related positive affect, which in turn supports students\u2019 positive school functioning and their overall school achievement. The results demonstrate the complex interplay between students\u2019 personality traits, affect, school functioning, and achievement at school."

    "description": [
      "Are there age differences in gratitude from early adulthood to old age? The current studies tested several ways by which an association between age and dispositional gratitude may present, by considering multiple measures on both fronts. We used data from three cross-sectional studies (total N\u2009=\u20091,736; total age range: 19\u201394). The results indicated that (a) age effects in gratitude are more likely to occur for subjective age in terms of future time perspective (i.e., people's perceptions of their remaining opportunities and time) than chronological age; (b) chronological age effects are more domain specific than general in nature; and (c) they are more likely to occur for the instrumental domain as compared to the interpersonal domain. Finally, the results indicated that (d) perceived future time, particularly with respect to remaining opportunities, mediates the relation between chronological age and general gratitude. Overall, the findings suggest that gratitude is subject to a variety of developmental influences across adulthood."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Health-risk information can elicit negative emotions like anticipated regret that may positively affect health persuasion. The beneficial impact of such emotions is undermined when target audiences respond defensively to the threatening information. We tested whether self-affirming (reflecting on cherished attributes) before message exposure can be used as strategy to enhance the experience of anticipated regret. Women were self-affirmed or not before exposure to a message promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. Self-affirmation increased anticipated regret and intentions reported following message exposure and consumption in the week after the intervention; regret mediated the affirmation effect on intentions. Moreover, results suggest that anticipated regret and intentions are serial mediators linking self-affirmation and behavior. By demonstrating the mediating role of anticipated regret, we provide insights into how self-affirmation may promote healthy intentions and behavior following health message exposure. Self-affirmation techniques could thus potentially be used to increase the effectiveness of health communication efforts."

      "Flirting in the field: shifting positionalities and power relations in innocuous sexualisations of research encounters"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In the last few decades, an engaged and sophisticated discussion about the production of data and power relations has developed within feminist methodology. Positionality, i.e. the set of relations constituting informants\u2019 and researchers\u2019 subject positions, has been widely used as an analytical tool to account for the complicated ways in which data are co-constructed in fieldwork. Based on our own experience of fieldwork conducted in the city of Zurich, however, we argue that sexuality is underrepresented in this debate. First, reflexive writing on fieldwork has been reluctant to consider sexuality as a category in the same way, for instance, as gender or race. Second, even apparently innocuous sexualisations have a considerable effect on the constitution of data and are therefore worth including in the analysis. In this article, we examine how flirtation as a part of the participant \u2013 researcher relation has re-shaped the research encounters in our respective research projects. We discuss the complex navigations between conflicting rationales that it entailed for us as researchers, depict the minor and major shifts in positionalities that emerge from the flirtation and examine the reasons why we sometimes embraced flirtation and sometimes rejected it. The objective of the article is to further enrich feminist methodological writing, and to suggest to the reader the potential for including various shades of sexual performances, such as apparently harmless flirtation, into our reflections on data collection."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The primary goal of this study is to empirically analyse the influence of colour distance and font size on map readability. We utilized eye-tracking to complement the classical usability metrics; thus, we studied performance metrics such as effectiveness (i.e. success, accuracy), efficiency (i.e. time to answer, task completion time), and selected eye tracking metrics fixation frequency, fixation duration and scanpath speed as well as conducting an area-of-interest (AOI) analysis to understand the performance and strategy issues that may be influenced by colour distance and font size during map reading. The user experiment was carried out in a controlled laboratory where participants were asked to conduct a visual search task and mark the correct answer with a mouse click on a static map on a computer screen. Collected data was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Task completion times for the five tested colour distances show that as the colour distances grow larger, the relative differences in task completion times become statistically significant; empirically confirming our intuition that larger colour distances are better for map readability. The comparison of the scanpath speeds for the tested font sizes suggests that the medium font size leads to a more efficient search."

    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate academic achievement and satisfaction in adolescents with CHD. Study design Questionnaires were sent to all adolescents, aged between 17 and 20 years with CHD, currently treated at our hospital (n=326) in order to assess the patients' education and satisfaction with their academic career. Results were compared with the official community statistics.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 207 patients completed the questionnaires (participation rate 63.5%), 113 boys and 94 girls; 50% had completed mandatory school at the highest, 37.3% at the middle, and 12.7% at the lowest educational level. The distribution in the general population was comparable: 57.6, 32.5, and 9.9%, respectively (p=0.8). Adolescents with severe CHD were less likely to attain a higher educational level than those with moderate or mild CHD (p=0.03 for school grades 7-9). None of the other examined medical or socio-demographic factors, such as socio-economic status, foreign language, severity of CHD, cyanosis, and open heart surgery, were found to be associated with lower educational attainment. After the mandatory 9 years of schooling, 21.4% (n=44) of the patients with CHD compared with 16.7% in the general population attended higher school levels heading towards university education (p=0.7). From the 165 patients who provided information on career satisfaction, 79% regarded their job or school situation as being their desired one without a difference for those with severe CHD.\r\nCONCLUSION: School education in Swiss adolescents with CHD is very similar to the normal population. In addition, the majority of adolescents are satisfied with their educational career. This fact may be due to the good educational support provided during schooling."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In Latin America, little research has been conducted regarding exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among foster children. This study examined the association between ACEs and mental health, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and HRQoL in Chilean foster girls relative to age-matched Chilean family girls. Data were obtained from 27 Chilean foster girls and 27 Chilean girls ages 6 to 17 years living in family homes. Standardized self- and proxy-report measures were used. Foster girls reported more ACEs than controls in terms of familial and nonfamilial sexual abuse and both emotional and physical neglect. Girls living in foster care had a significantly higher rate of PTSD, displayed greater behavioral and emotional problems, and reported a lower HRQoL. Analysis confirmed the well-known cumulative risk hypothesis by demonstrating a significant positive association between the number of ACEs and PTSD symptom severity and a significant negative association with HRQoL. Chilean foster girls endured more ACEs that impair mental health and HRQoL than age-matched peers living with their families. These findings have implications for out-of-home care services in Latin America, highlighting the need to implement not only appropriate trauma-focused treatments but also appropriate prevention strategies."

    ],
    "description": [
      "A majority of individuals living in the U.S. experience unhealthy levels of stress; however, romantic partners can help mitigate stress\u2019 deleterious effects by coping together (dyadic coping). The Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI) measures coping behaviors when one or both partners experience stress. Specifically, the DCI measures a) partner\u2019s self-report of his/her own (Self) and their partner\u2019s (Partner) behavior, and b) Common DC during the experience of a common stressor. Despite its wide use, the DCI has not yet been validated for use in the United States (U.S.). The aim of this study was to address this gap in the literature. Using a sample of 938 individuals in the U.S. currently involved in a romantic relationship, we validated the English version of the DCI by analyzing its factorial structure and psychometric properties. Results supported the theoretically assumed factorial structure of the DCI. Convergent and discriminant validity, as well as measurement invariance across gender and culture using the original Swiss sample, was confirmed. The English version of the DCI is a valid self-report instrument for assessing couples' coping in the U.S."

    ],
    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nPsychological resilience has been rarely investigated in elderly populations. We applied a more comprehensive model of trauma-specific coping and resilience, which included Ungar's context model and included decentral factors of resilience (i.e., environments that provide resources to build resilience).\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nWe assessed resilience in a cohort of former Swiss indentured child laborers (N = 74; 59% males) at two time points; first at the mean age of 80 years and then again 20 months later. At each time point, the following measures of resilience were assessed: resilience indicators of life satisfaction and lack of depression. In addition, resilience predictors of trauma exposure, perceived social support, dysfunctional disclosure of traumatic experiences, social acknowledgment as a victim, and self-efficacy; and decentral resilience factors of education, income, number of children, and physical health were measured.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nUsing path-analysis, we found that life satisfaction and lack of depression were predicted by dysfunctional disclosure, social support, and self-efficacy at various significance levels. Change scores of resilience were predicted by higher trauma exposure, social acknowledgment as a victim, and an interaction between the two. The model for decentral factors also fitted, with physical health and income predicting the resilience indicators.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nApplying this comprehensive resilience model in a sample of older adults revealed meaningful findings in predicting resilience at a single time point and over time. Atypical coping strategies, such as perceived social acknowledgment as a victim and disclosure, may be particularly important for former victims who have suffered institutional abuse."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Future climate change may lead to a substantial loss of biodiversity, particularly affecting mountain regions, including the Alps. Range-size reduction in high mountain plant species is predicted to be more pronounced for endemic species. Investigating the broad temporal spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming trends in the present and future. Using species distribution models and an ensemble forecasting approach, we explored how the distribution of Berardia subacaulis, a monospecific genus endemic of the south-west Alps, may be affected by past and future projected climate change. During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more than 80 % of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ, expanding its distributional range during cooler periods. The severe future range contraction predicted for Berardia reflects similar results for other endemic species. As Berardia represents an interesting model species to evaluate the effects of climate warming on range size and shifts, demographic and precise range monitoring may be undertaken on this species."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The current study investigated discrepancies in self-, partner-, and meta-perceptions of the Big Five traits and their associations with relationship satisfaction in intimate couples. The study was based on a subsample of the Swiss study \"Co-Development in Personality: Longitudinal Approaches to Personality Development in Dyads Across the Life Span\" (CoDiP) including cross-sectional data of 216 heterosexual couples. We adapted the Latent Congruence Model (LCM) for the study of discrepancies in personality perceptions in dyads. Beyond personality trait levels, the discrepancies between self- and partner-perceptions and between partner- and meta-perceptions of the Big Five traits were related to relationship satisfaction as actor and partner effects. In general, flattering and favorable partner-perceptions in relation to self- and meta-perceptions seem to positively contribute to relationship satisfaction. The present study implies that not only personality trait levels but also discrepancies between personality perceptions are important for understanding relationship satisfaction."

      "Goal disengagement in emerging adulthood: The adaptive potential of action crises"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In emerging adulthood, being committed to and making progress on important personal goals constitutes a source of identity and well- being. Goal striving, however, does not always go without problems. Even though highly committed to a goal, individuals may experience recurring setbacks and, consequently, increasing doubts about the goal that might culminate in an action crisis, that is, an intra-psychic decisional conflict about whether to disengage from or to continue on their way. Action crises have been shown to lead to negative consequences on well-being and performance. Besides these negative consequences, however, an action crisis is hypothesized to have an adaptive side that is addressed in the present paper. Actively questioning the pursuit of a goal should allow for weighing up the focal goal against alternative and possibly more desirable goals. This open-minded re-evaluation, in the event of goal disengagement, is assumed to avoid the emergence of action crises in subsequently formed goals. As expected, in a longitudinal study over one and a half years with n 1\u20444 207 freshman students, the degree of experienced action crisis prior to goal disengagement predicted the desirability and decisional certainty of the subsequently formed alternative goal. Theoretical implications of the results for research on self-regulation and identity formation in emerging adulthood are discussed."

      "Differentiating responsibilities for climate change adaptation"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF), the parties to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed \u201cthat adaptation is a challenge faced by all Parties, and that enhanced action and international cooperation is urgently required to enable and support the implementation of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing country Parties [\u2026].\u201d  Furthermore, the conference of the parties (COP) requests the developed countries to provide developing countries with additional finance, technology, and capacity-building.  This paper argues that this decision tends to oversimplify matters because it seems to differentiate responsibilities for climate change adaptation according to differences in the contribution to anthropogenic climate change only. However, the differentiation of responsibilities for climate change adaptation is more complex than it first appears to be.\r\nTo show why the differentiation of responsibilities for climate change adaptation is more complex, this paper analyzes the aspects of responsibility as a fourfold concept.  Someone (i. the subject of responsibility) is always responsible for something (ii. the object of responsibility), answerable to some institution (iii.), and held accountable to a norm (iv.). The paper argues, first, that the appropriate object of responsibility in climate change adaptation is the burdens to be shared for effective and efficient adaptation. Second, for such adaptation to occur, however, subjects of responsibility should not only be developed countries. If appropriate competence and decision-structures are given in developing countries, these countries should also be deemed responsible for their own adaptation. Third, the paper shows that those vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change should decide on their own what adaptation measures they wish to take. Fourth, the argument of this paper suggests that ability-to-pay principles are the most appropriate norms by which to blame countries for failing their responsibilities in climate change adaptation."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Based on representative surveys on Internet use, this article advances comparative research on the second-level digital divide by modeling Internet usage disparities for five countries with narrowing access gaps. Four core Internet usage types are constructed and predicted by sociodemographic variables in a structural model. Overall, the findings confirm the recently identified shift in the digital divide from access to usage in five further countries. Results show that sociodemographics alone account for up to half of the variance in usage in these high-penetration countries, with age being the strongest predictor. Measurement invariance tests indicate that a direct comparison is only valid between three of the five countries explored. Methodologically, this points to the indispensability of such tests for unbiased comparative research."

      "Heritability of floral volatiles and pleiotropic responses to artificial selection in Brassica rapa"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The evolution of the vast diversity of floral volatiles is little understood, although they serve fundamental functions, such as pollinator attraction and herbivore deterrence. Floral volatiles are often species specific, yet highly variable and sensitive to environmental factors. To date, nothing is known about the heritability of floral volatiles, and whether individual compounds can evolve independently or solely in concert with the whole volatile bouquet. We conducted bi-directional artificial selection on four target floral volatiles to estimate heritability and correlated pleiotropic responses in the wild turnip (Brassica rapa). The realized heritability of the four target volatiles ranged from 20% to 45%. The average narrow-sense heritability of all 13 analyzed floral volatiles was 18% based on parent-offspring regressions. There were pleiotropic effects of the selected floral volatile compounds on other constituents of the floral scent bouquet, on flowering time and on some morphological traits. We found that the whole floral scent bouquet changed, even when there was selection only on single compounds, with the overall phenotypic covariance being unaffected. Our study demonstrates that floral scent can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection, but with additional correlated responses in traits that are not direct targets of selection."

    ],
    "description": [
      "With software automatically producing texts in natural language from structured data, the evolution of natural language generation (NLG) is changing traditional news production. The paper first addresses the question whether NLG is able to perform the functions of professional journalism on a technical level. A technological potential analysis therefore uncovers the technological limitations and possibilities of NLG, accompanied by an institutional classification following Weischenberg, Malik, and Scholl. Overall, NLG is explained within the framework of algorithmic selection and along its technological functionality. The second part of the paper focuses on the economic potential of NLG in journalism as well as indicating its institutionalization on an organizational level. Thirteen semi-structured interviews with representatives of the most relevant service providers detail the current market situation. Following Heuss, the development of the NLG market is classified into phases. In summary, although the market for NLG in journalism is still at an early stage of market expansion, with only a few providers and journalistic products available, NLG is able to perform tasks of professional journalism at a technical level. The analysis therefore sets the basis to analyze upcoming challenges for journalism research at the intersection of technology and big data."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Stress has been found to have both positive and negative effects on prosocial behavior, suggesting the involvement of moderating factors such as context and underlying motives. In the present study, we investigated the conditions under which acute stress leads to an increase vs. decrease in environmental donation behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In particular, we examined whether the effects of stress depended on preexisting pro-environmental orientation and stage of the donation decision (whether or not to donate vs. the amount to be donated).\r\n\r\nMale participants with either high (N = 40) or low (N = 39) pro-environmental orientation were randomly assigned to a social stress test or a control condition. Salivary cortisol was assessed repeatedly before and after stress induction. At the end of the experiment, all subjects were presented with an opportunity to donate a portion of their monetary compensation to a climate protection foundation.\r\n\r\nWe found that stress significantly increased donation frequency, but only in subjects with low pro-environmental orientation. Congruously, their decision to donate was positively associated with cortisol response to the stress test and the emotion regulation strategy mood repair, as well as accompanied by an increase in subjective calmness. In contrast, among the participants who decided to donate, stress significantly reduced the donated amount of money, regardless of pro-environmental orientation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that acute stress might generally activate more self-serving motivations, such as making oneself feel better and securing one\u2019s own material interests. Importantly, however, a strong pro-environmental orientation partially prevented these effects."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Mental health benefits of mindfulness techniques are thought to involve changes in self-processing, such as decreased attachment to the self, higher self-compassion and lower emotional reactivity to inner experience. However, self-related emotion processing in regular mindfulness practitioners is not extensively studied. In the current work we investigate differential neural and behavioral correlates of self-criticism and self-praise in 22 mid-to-long-term mindfulness meditators (LTM) compared to 22 matched meditation-na\u00efve participants (MNP). In an fMRI experiment, participants were presented with blocks of individually selected positive (self-praise, SP), negative (self-critical, SC), negative but not-self-critical (NNSC), and general, neutral (NT) adjectives, and reported their affective state after the blocks. On the neural level, both SP and SC yielded more activation in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in LTM compared to MNP. Activation in this region correlated positively with non-react scores of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and showed decreased functional connectivity to posterior midline and parietal regions in LTM compared to MNP during both self-related appraisals. Further, we found evidence for emotional reactivity in LTM on the neural level, particularly during SP. On the behavioral level, a mixed effects analysis revealed significantly higher differences in affective ratings after blocks of SC compared to SP in MNP compared to LTM. Differences in DMPFC activation and affective ratings point towards increased awareness, potentially mindful regulation of SC and SP in LTM, while decreased connectivity to other regions of the default mode network could reflect a decreased self-focus in this group. As such, our results illustrate differences in self-related emotional processes in meditators and offer clinically relevant insights into mechanisms of mindful emotion regulation when facing self-criticism and self-praise."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus-infected patients treated with antibiotics that are effective in vitro often experience relapse of infection because the bacteria hide in privileged locations. These locations include abscesses and host cells, which contain low-pH compartments and are sites from which nonstable S. aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) are frequently recovered.\r\nMETHODS: We assessed the effect of low pH on S. aureus colony phenotype and bacterial growth, using in vitro and in vivo models of long-term infection.\r\nRESULTS:\u2003We showed that low pH induced nonstable SCVs and nonreplicating persisters that are capable of regrowth. Within host cells, S. aureus was located in phagolysosomes, a low-pH compartment. Therapeutic neutralization of phagolysosomal pH with ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or the antimalaria drug chloroquine reduced SCVs in infected host cells. In a systemic mouse infection model, treatment with chloroquine also reduced SCVs.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the acidic environment favors formation of nonstable SCVs, which reflect the SCVs found in clinics. They also provide evidence that treatment with alkalinizing agents, together with antibiotics, may provide a novel translational strategy for eradicating persisting intracellular reservoirs of staphylococci. This approach may also be extended to other intracellular bacteria."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This book discusses how the extension of voting rights beyond citizenship (i.e., to non-national immigrants) and residence (i.e., to expatriates) can be interpreted in the light of democratization processes in both Western countries and in developing regions. It does so by inserting the globalization-specific extension of voting rights to immigrants and expatriates within the long-term series of historical waves of democratization. Does the current extension enhance democracy by granting de facto disenfranchised immigrants and emigrants political rights or does it jeopardize the very functioning of democracy by undermining its legitimacy through the removal of territorial and national boundaries? The book offers a preliminary synthesis in a broad comparative perspective covering both alien and external voting rights in Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. It shows that reforms toward more expansive electorates vary considerably and that their effects on the inclusion of migrants largely depend on the specific regulations and the socio-political context in which they operate. The book was originally published as a special issue of Democratization."

In the present study, we aimed to extend these findings to pro-environmental behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In a first step, 147 male participants provided information on their everyday pro-environmental behavior by completing an online questionnaire on various energy-saving behaviors. In a second step, subjects provided two saliva samples for the assessment of testosterone and cortisol on two subsequent mornings after awakening. We found that testosterone was negatively related to pro-environmental behavior, but only in men with low cortisol. In conclusion, our findings provide first evidence for the joint association of testosterone and cortisol with everyday pro-environmental behavior. These results further reinforce the importance of considering interdependent hormone systems simultaneously rather than focusing on a single hormone."

      "Communication About Micropollutants in Drinking Water: Effects of the Presentation and Psychological Processes"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This study investigates how people change their risk perception, trust, and behavior as a consequence of being informed about the occurrence of micropollutants in drinking water. Micropollutants are substances present in extremely low concentrations that might be dangerous in higher concentrations. Data were gathered in the city of Zurich, Switzerland in 2013 using a questionnaire in which the information on micropollutants was presented differently to 12 experimental groups. Data of the key constructs were gathered before and after this information, so that causal effects could be quantified by regression analyses. Affective reactions to the information turned out to be the critical mediator of changes in risk perception (operationalized as the perceived change of quality due to pollution), which is an important determinant of changes in behavior and trust. Also, direct effects of affective reactions on behavior and trust were observed. Trust before appraising risks reduces negative affective reactions; however, it also reduces perceived quality (i.e., increases risk perception) and trust after risks are appraised. The different forms of information mainly influenced the participants' affective reactions, but they also influenced perceived quality. The presentation with the least negative effects was a comparison of the intake of the substance by water with intake by food. The experimental design with repeated measurement that considers trust as a determinant and consequence of risk perception uncovered positive and negative effects of trust before appraising risks on changes of risk perception and trust due to appraising risks."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Theory-based interventions can enhance people's safe water consumption, but the sustainability of these interventions and the mechanisms of maintenance remain unclear. We investigated these questions based on an extended theory of planned behaviour. Seven hundred and ten (445 analysed) randomly selected households participated in two cluster-randomised controlled trials in Bangladesh. Study 1 promoted switching to neighbours' arsenic-safe wells, and Study 2 promoted switching to arsenic-safe deep wells. Both studies included two intervention phases. Structured interviews were conducted at baseline (T1), and at 1-month (T2), 2-month (T3) and 9-month (T4) follow-ups. In intervention phase 1 (between T1 and T2), commitment-based behaviour change techniques - reminders, implementation intentions and public commitment - were combined with information and compared to an information-only control group. In phase 2 (between T2 and T3), half of each phase 1 intervention group was randomly assigned to receive either commitment-based techniques once more or coping planning with reminders and information. Initial well-switching rates of up to 60% significantly declined by T4: 38.3% of T2 safe water users stopped consuming arsenic-safe water. The decline depended on the intervention. Perceived behavioural control, intentions, commitment strength and coping planning were associated with maintenance. In line with previous studies, the results indicate that commitment and reminders engender long-term behavioural change."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The politicisation of European governance has become an important subject in debates about the institutional design, day-to-day decision-making and democratic legitimacy of the European Union. This special issue takes stock of this development of politicisation research, including the theoretical development as well as the rapidly expanding body of empirical evidence. It synergises the various perspectives on politicisation of European governance, building on a common understanding of politicisation as a three-dimensional process involving increasing salience, polarisation of opinion and the expansion of actors and audiences involved in EU issues. The introduction outlines the central theoretical and conceptual questions concerning the politicisation of European governance and provides a guiding framework for the contributions to this special issue. The contributions document that a differentiated Europe leads to differentiated politicisation across times, countries and settings. The differentiated patterns, particularly across countries, present profound challenges to the future trajectory of European integration and its democratic legitimacy."

      "A structural approach to politicisation in the Euro crisis"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Domestic opportunity structures and political actors\u2019 positions are widely regarded as the most important explanatory factors for EU politicisation. The euro crisis, however, has revealed cleavages across rather than within countries, suggesting structural factors as a potential explanation for politicisation. Based on the political economy literature on Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union, this contribution develops a structural approach to politicisation with respect to countries\u2019 power and variety of capitalism. Using a content and claims analysis of business papers in Germany, France, Austria and Ireland before and during the crisis, the findings reveal a differentiated pattern of politicisation. While an expansion of actors indicates that EMU became more politicised during the crisis, polarisation remained low within countries. Countries\u2019 variety of capitalism and their perceived power in the EU largely explain the substance and objects of politicisation. The findings encourage further research considering structural explanations for differentiated politicisation in less elite-centred settings of politicisation."

    ],
    "description": [
      "PURPOSE  To review data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with childhood trauma, including psychological maltreatment, physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, and neglect.  METHODS  The literature search was conducted with pre-defined keywords using the following electronic bibliographic databases: EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsyINFO, PSYNDEX, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Further databases were searched for relevant dissertations. Study selection and data extraction were completed by two independent reviewers.  RESULTS  The literature search yielded 1568 entries. Nineteen articles met all inclusion criteria and were retained for further analysis. Findings quite consistently showed significant negative associations between child maltreatment and both self- and proxy-rated HRQoL. Effect sizes range from small to large. Number of types of maltreatment and HRQoL were found to be negatively related.  CONCLUSION  Data on HRQoL for maltreated children are still rare. Studies often investigate adult survivors of child maltreatment. Considering HRQoL in children and adolescents who suffered maltreatment would allow the planning of effective interventions and the evaluation of treatments to improve HRQoL of these children."

      "BACKGROUND  Prevalence rates of child maltreatment (CM) can differ substantially between countries and ethnicities. Reasons, however, are complex and not sufficiently understood.  METHOD  This epidemiological study examined prevalence and risk factors of various types of CM in a population-based representative sample of native and immigrant adolescents in Switzerland (N = 6,787).  RESULTS  The prevalence of CM in general was lowest in the native group, higher in the Western immigrant group, and highest in the non-Western immigrant groups. An immigrant background was related to an overrepresentation of several risk factors for CM. Adjusted odds ratio of an immigrant background were still significant for physical and emotional abuse but not for neglect and sexual assault.  CONCLUSIONS  Differences in the prevalence of CM across ethnographic origins are at least partially related to socioeconomic and ecologic risk factors. The distribution of risk factors may vary depending on the contexts of migration."

      "OBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThis longitudinal experimental study compared effects of self-efficacy, planning and education-based conditions, encouraging adolescents to eat fruit and vegetable in place of energy-dense foods.\r\n\r\nDESIGN\r\n\r\nData were collected among 506 adolescents (13-18\u00a0years old) who were randomly assigned to control (n\u00a0=\u00a0181), planning (n\u00a0=\u00a0153) or self-efficacy (n\u00a0=\u00a0172) conditions. Measurements were taken at baseline (T1), at a 2-month follow-up (T2), and at a 14-month follow-up (T3). Interventions/control group procedures were delivered at T1 and T2.\r\n\r\nOUTCOME MEASURES\r\n\r\nSelf-reports of fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) and energy-dense foods intake were collected at three times. Cognitive mediators (self-efficacy and planning) were assessed at T1 and T2. Body weight and height were objectively measured at T1 and T3.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nSimilar significant increases of FVI were found for planning and self-efficacy interventions (T3). The planning intervention did not influence energy-dense food intake (T3), but the self-efficacy intervention tended to result in stabilising intake (compared to an increase found in the control group). There were no effects on body weight. Similar patterns were found for the total sample and for a subsample of adolescents with overweight/obesity. The effects of interventions on FVI were mediated by respective cognitions."

    ],
    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVE: Social support from one's partner is assumed to be beneficial for successful smoking cessation. However, thus far, no study has examined the fine-grained temporal dynamics of daily support and smoking in the process of quitting.\r\nMETHOD: In this longitudinal mobile phone study, smokers (N = 100, 28% women, mean age = 40.48 years) reported daily number of cigarettes smoked and how much smoking-specific emotional and instrumental social support they received from their partner for 10 days before and 21 days after a self-set quit date. Nonsmoking partners' (N = 99, mean age = 38.95 years) reports of provision of support were assessed to validate the smokers' self-reports regarding support received. Time-lagged analyses were conducted using a change-predicting-change model.\r\nRESULTS: Prior and concurrent increases in received emotional smoking-specific support were related to less smoking. Effects were more pronounced after the quit date, which is when support is most needed. Prior change in smoking did not predict change in received support. Results with partner reports of provision of support and results with instrumental support were almost identical.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Daily changes in social support preceded and accompanied daily changes in smoking particularly after a self-set quit date. Findings emphasize the need for a prospective daily diary approach to understand the dynamics of social support in smoking cessation. (PsycINFO Database Record"

    ],
    "description": [
      "The age benefit found in many naturalistic prospective memory (PM) tasks has been taken as evidence that PM performance in real life may be spared from aging. However, this conclusion lacks empirical confirmation. Hence, the aim of the present study was to examine possible age differences in the content of everyday PM intentions and their performance. Everyday PM was assessed in young and older adults using a diary approach. Results confirmed a general age benefit for real-life PM tasks. Importantly, this finding was qualified by revealing that the benefit only held true for specific types of intentions such as health and social intentions. Further, moderation analyses showed that the relationships between cognitive functioning and everyday PM were different for young and older adults. While better inhibition, short-term and long-term memory were related with successful PM performance in the young, this was not the case in the older adults. The present findings suggest that the age benefit found in naturalistic experimenter-given tasks extends to real-life PM performance, but may differ depending on the type of intention. Furthermore, cognitive functioning predicts performance in the young, but not in the older adults."

      "Evidence for two different ICD-11 posttraumatic stress disorders in a community sample of adolescents and young adults"
    ],
    "description": [
      "For the 11th revision of the International classification of diseases, a general category of posttraumatic stress disorders has been proposed with two distinct sibling disorders: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). General population data are examined on evidence for these two disorders. Data were drawn from a 10-year prospective longitudinal, epidemiological study with a representative community sample (N\u00a0=\u00a03021, 14-24\u00a0years at baseline) in Germany. Mixture modelling on latent classes was conducted in a subset of all reported episodes with exposure to interpersonal traumas. Associations between class membership, symptom criteria, and other mental disorders were investigated. Four distinctly interpretable latent classes were found. Class 1 episodes (N\u00a0=\u00a0181) typically included core PTSD symptoms associated with strong impairment (OR 11.68; 95\u00a0% CI 4.54-30.05). 18.3\u00a0% of these episodes matched the criteria of ICD-11 PTSD. Class 2 episodes (N\u00a0=\u00a078) had a high probability of PTSD core symptoms and disturbances in self-organization and were associated with strong impairment (OR 38.47; 95\u00a0% CI 15.77-93.86). Half of them (49.4\u00a0%) matched the proposed ICD-11 criteria of CPTSD. Class 3 (N\u00a0=\u00a079) was typically characterized by episodes with disturbances in self-organization but a low probability of PTSD core symptoms and impairment. Class 4 (N\u00a0=\u00a0633) was related to a relatively low probability of symptom reports. Membership in class 2 was associated with lower educational attainment, a lower social class, and more other mental disorders. Findings support the ICD-11 proposal to differentiate between PTSD and CPTSD. Further studies should extend exploration to other types of traumatic events in samples covering the full age range."

      "Age-Related Neural Oscillation Patterns During the Processing of Temporally Manipulated Speech"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This EEG-study aims to investigate age-related differences in the neural oscillation patterns during the processing of temporally modulated speech. Viewing from a lifespan perspective, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) data of three age samples: young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults. Stimuli consisted of temporally degraded sentences in Swedish-a language unfamiliar to all participants. We found age-related differences in phonetic pattern matching when participants were presented with envelope-degraded sentences, whereas no such age-effect was observed in the processing of fine-structure-degraded sentences. Irrespective of age, during speech processing the EEG data revealed a relationship between envelope information and the theta band (4-8\u00a0Hz) activity. Additionally, an association between fine-structure information and the gamma band (30-48\u00a0Hz) activity was found. No interaction, however, was found between acoustic manipulation of stimuli and age. Importantly, our main finding was paralleled by an overall enhanced power in older adults in high frequencies (gamma: 30-48\u00a0Hz). This occurred irrespective of condition. For the most part, this result is in line with the Asymmetric Sampling in Time framework (Poeppel in Speech Commun 41:245-255, 2003), which assumes an isomorphic correspondence between frequency modulations in neurophysiological patterns and acoustic oscillations in spoken language. We conclude that speech-specific neural networks show strong stability over adulthood, despite initial processes of cortical degeneration indicated by enhanced gamma power. The results of our study therefore confirm the concept that sensory and cognitive processes undergo multidirectional trajectories within the context of healthy aging."

    ],
    "description": [
      "We report novel research investigating memory distortion as an alternative route to cognitive balance, comparing it with attitude change as a well-known balancing mechanism. Participants received statements from multiple communicators about a controversial topic (national pride in Study 1 and climate protection in Study 2) and remembered these statements immediately or 1\u2009week later. This resulted in initially balanced or unbalanced combinations of the liking for individual communicators and the communicators' statements and in subsequent balance increases due to liking change or misremembering of statements. The contribution of memory distortion to balance was significant but weaker and less efficient than that of liking change, and the contributions were empirically independent (i.e., uncorrelated and differentially related to third variables\u2014specifically, memory strength and individual cognitive consistency motivation). They also had a different temporal trajectory (liking change fast and memory distortion slow). We discuss theoretical and practical implications."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Several experimental and cross-sectional studies have established the stress-buffering effect of social identification, yet few longitudinal studies have been conducted within this area of research. This study is the first to make use of a multilevel approach to disaggregate between- and within-person effects of social identification on subjective and endocrinological stress reactions. Specifically, we conducted a study with 85 prospective students during their 1-day aptitude test for a university sports program. Ad hoc groups were formed, in which students completed several tests in various disciplines together. At four points in time, salivary cortisol, subjective strain, and identification with their group were measured. Results of multilevel analyses show a significant within-person effect of social identification: The more students identified with their group, the less stress they experienced and the lower their cortisol response was. Between-person effects were not significant. Advantages of using multilevel approaches within this field of research are discussed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present study examined the associations of implicit and explicit power motives with the well-being of teachers. Teachers (N = 170) participated in an online assessment, which included measures for implicit motives (assessed by the operant motive test), explicit motives, and well-being. We expected congruently high power motives to be linked with the highest levels of well-being. We tested this assumption using polynomial regressions with response surface analysis. Results were consistent with our hypothesis. Additionally, there was an effect of directional motive incongruence (a combination of a low implicit and a high explicit power motive was associated with higher well-being than a high implicit/low explicit combination), which did not hold when controlling for emotional stability. Results for achievement were comparable, but weaker, and there was no effect for motive incongruence. No significant associations were found for motive (in)congruence in the affiliation domain. Our findings underline the importance of the power motive in understanding individual differences in teachers\u2019 well-being."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article argues that discourses of a newspaper \u201ccrisis\u201d should not be regarded simply as descriptions of the actual state of the press but also as a means by which strategic actors frame the situation. The emerging frames can have substantial consequences for media policy making. The study identifies four key frames used to portray the newspaper \u201ccrisis\u201d and discusses their relevance for public debates in Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. Similarities and differences are examined through 59 in-depth interviews with policymakers and industry executives as well as a qualitative analysis of policy documents and relevant media coverage. The study demonstrates that debates on the newspaper \u201ccrisis\u201d are only partly influenced by (1) economic realities and (2) media policy traditions in the six countries but also reflect (3) the strategic motives of powerful actors and (4) the diffusion of frames across borders, particularly those coming from the United States. A transnationally uniform paradigm emerges according to which the state is expected to play the role of a benevolent but mostly passive bystander, while media companies are expected to tackle the problem mainly by developing innovative content and business strategies. This liberal market paradigm displays one blind spot however: it does not seriously consider a scenario where the market is failing to provide sustainable journalistic quality."

    "description": [
      "This study examined developmental trajectories of social justice values (SJV) in a representative sample of Swiss adolescents (N\u2009=\u20091258) at 15 (Time 1), 18 (Time 2), and 21 years of age (Time 3). SJV and friendship quality were measured via self-reports. Sympathy was assessed via self- and mother-reports. Latent class growth analysis revealed three developmental trajectories of SJV: high-stable (80 percent), moderate-decreasing (17 percent), and low-increasing (3 percent). Adolescents with low levels of self- and mother-reported sympathy were more likely to be members of the low-increasing than the high-stable or moderate decreasing trajectory groups. Adolescents who reported low levels of sympathy and friendship quality at 15 years of age were more likely to be members of the moderate-decreasing trajectory group than the high-stable trajectory group. Results are discussed with respect to the potential significance of sympathy and friendship quality for understanding the development of SJV during adolescence."

    "description": [
      "The concept of representation has a vast and highly diverse extension. In this paper I distinguish four kinds of representation, viz. proxy, make-believe, and intentional representation, as well as representation simpliciter. The bulk of the paper is devoted to intentional representation. I argue that the relation of intentional representation is non-reflexive, non-symmetrical, and non-transitive. I articulate a fundamental distinction between two aspects of the content of intentional representations, viz. subject and predicative content. Finally, I qualify and defend the distinction between iconic and symbolic intentional representation. Along the way, I also argue that psychological intentions play a constitutive role in representation."

    ],
    "description": [
      "As part of the development of the Eleventh Revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), the World Health Organization Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse is conducting a series of case-controlled field studies using a new and powerful method to test the application by clinicians of the proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for mental and behavioural disorders. This article describes the case-controlled field study for Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress. Using a vignette-based experimental methodology, 1,738 international mental health professionals diagnosed standardized cases designed to test key differences between the proposed diagnostic guidelines for ICD-11 and corresponding guidelines for ICD-10. Across eight comparisons, several proposed changes for ICD-11, including the addition of Complex PTSD and Prolonged Grief Disorder, produced significantly improved diagnostic decisions and clearer application of diagnostic guidelines compared to ICD-10. However, several key areas were also identified, such as the description of the diagnostic requirement of re-experiencing in PTSD, in which the guidelines were not consistently applied as intended. These results informed specific revisions to improve the clarity of the proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. The next step will be to further test these guidelines in clinic-based studies using real patients in relevant settings."

      "How and why do interviewers try to make impressions on applicants? A qualitative study"
    ],
    "description": [
      "To remain viable in today's highly competitive business environments, it is crucial for organizations to attract and retain top candidates. Hence, interviewers have the goal not only of identifying promising applicants but also of representing their organization. Although it has been proposed that interviewers' deliberate signaling behaviors are a key factor for attracting applicants and thus for ensuring organizations' success, no conceptual model about impression management (IM) exists from the viewpoint of the interviewer as separate from the applicant. To develop such a conceptual model on how and why interviewers use IM, our qualitative study elaborates signaling theory in the interview context by identifying the broad range of impressions that interviewers intend to create on applicants, what kinds of signals interviewers deliberately use to create their intended impressions, and what outcomes they pursue. Following a grounded theory approach, multiple raters analyzed in-depth interviews with interviewers and applicants. We also observed actual employment interviews and analyzed memos and image brochures to generate a conceptual model of interviewer IM. Results showed that the spectrum of interviewers' IM intentions goes well beyond what has been proposed in past research. Furthermore, interviewers apply a broad range of IM behaviors, including verbal and nonverbal as well as paraverbal, artifactual, and administrative behaviors. An extensive taxonomy of interviewer IM intentions, behaviors, and intended outcomes is developed, interrelationships between these elements are presented, and avenues for future research are derived.

    ],
    "description": [
      "Assessment centers (ACs) are popular selection devices in which assessees are assessed on several dimensions during different exercises. Surveys indicate that ACs vary with regard to the transparency of the targeted dimensions and that the number of transparent ACs has increased during recent years. Furthermore, research on this design feature has put conceptual arguments forward regarding the effects of transparency on criterion-related validity, impression management, and fairness perceptions. This study is the first to examine these effects using supervisor-rated job performance data as the criterion. We conducted simulated ACs with transparency as a between-subjects factor. The sample consisted of part-time employed participants who would soon be applying for a new job. In line with our hypothesis, results showed that ratings from an AC with nontransparent dimensions were more criterion valid than ratings from an AC with transparent dimensions. Concerning impression management, our results supported the hypothesis that transparency moderates the relationship between self-promotion and job performance, such that self-promotion in the nontransparent AC was more positively related to job performance than self-promotion in the transparent AC. The data lent no support for the hypothesis that participants\u2019 perceptions of their opportunity to perform are higher in the transparent AC."

    "description": [
      "This article is based on the premise that journalists play an important role as mediators of scientific information and their interpretations of climate change influence media debates and public opinion. The study maps the minds of climate journalists from five different countries (Germany, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and different types of leading media outlets. It identifies five cognitive frames that vary between attributing the responsibility for climate change to lobbying and national interests, blaming consumerist culture and the capitalist system, and expressing technological optimism. The study provides evidence for the emergence of a sustainability frame, indicates a \u201cblame game\u201d between industrialized countries and emerging economies, and shows the demand for a global ecological discourse. Finally, it explores how individual factors such as specialization, professional aims, and political alignment correlate with the cognitive frames of journalists."

      "Political News in Online and Print Newspapers: Are online editions better by electoral democratic standards?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The electoral model of democracy holds the ideal of citizens who are well informed about politics, and regards it as a task of news media to provide citizens with political information. Against this ideal, the quality of political news in online news outlets is highly contested. While pessimists point out the dangers of increased competition online, optimists emphasize the potential benefits of unlimited space and interactivity. To see which view holds true, this paper compares political news in popular and elite print newspapers and their respective online editions during the 2013 National Election Campaign in Austria. Findings show that online editions score better than paper editions regarding the amount of political news, (party) diversity, and emotionalization, but differences between newspaper types were notable. Whereas elite newspapers cover politics online more extensively than in print, the reverse is true for popular newspapers. Leader focus is also strong in popular papers online. We conclude that the gap in quality between political news in elite and in popular newspapers is larger online. This might contribute to a wider gap between a well-informed elite audience and a lesser-informed popular news audience, when audiences switch from print to online news."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article analyzes intermedia agenda-setting processes during a national election campaign of 38 newspapers, online news sites, TV news programs, as well as a wire service, through semi-automatic content analysis and time series analysis. The theoretical assumption was that intermedia agenda-setting is determined by the production structures of certain media types, the opinion-leader role of specific media outlets, and issue-specific characteristics. The findings suggest that, despite previous evidence to the contrary, intermedia agenda-setting also occurs during election campaigns, with a short time lag of 1\u2009day. Additionally, a medium\u2019s opinion-leader role depends strongly on issue-specific characteristics, such as obtrusiveness and proximity, mediating the intermedia agenda-setting process. And the traditional role of print media as intermedia agenda-setters is found to be challenged by online news sites."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This was a study on the perceived enjoyment of different movie genres. In an online experiment, 176 students were randomly divided into two groups (n = 88) and asked to estimate how much they, their closest friends, and young people in general enjoyed either serious or light-hearted movies. These self\u2013other differences in perceived enjoyment of serious or light-hearted movies were also assessed as a function of differing individual motivations underlying entertainment media consumption. The results showed a clear third-person effect for light-hearted movies and a first-person effect for serious movies. The third-person effect for light-hearted movies was moderated by level of hedonic motivation, as participants with high hedonic motivations did not perceive their own and others\u2019 enjoyment of light-hearted films differently. However, eudaimonic motivations did not moderate first-person perceptions in the case of serious films."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Recent research demonstrates that intergenerational differences in immigrant families' adaptation can be detrimental for family functioning. However, most of the findings originate from immigrant groups in North America who face different situations compared with European Diaspora returnees. This comparative study investigated whether ethnic German Diaspora immigrant adolescents' and mothers' disagreement about the desirability of adolescents' intercultural contact with native peers relates to more conflict in the family domain. In addition, we accounted for general developmental factors predicting family conflict by considering adolescents' background in terms of prosocial behaviour and hyperactivity. Participants comprised 185 Diaspora immigrant mother\u2013adolescent dyads from the former Soviet Union living in Germany (adolescents: mean age 15.7 years, 60% female) and 197 native German mother\u2013adolescent dyads (adolescents: mean age 14.7 years, 53% female). Results indicated a similar level of family conflict in immigrant and native families. However, conflict was elevated in those immigrant families disagreeing on intercultural contact attitudes, independent of the significant effects of adolescents' background of prosocial behaviour or hyperactivity. Our study highlights potential side effects in the family domain, if immigrant adolescents and parents disagree in their attitude regarding adaptation to the host culture's life domains, such as contact with native peers."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Zonally elongated areas of cloudiness that make up the east Pacific Intertropical 25 Convergence Zone (ITCZ) can take on several configurations in instantaneous 26 observations. A novel statistical model is used to automatically assess the daily state of 27 the east Pacific ITCZ using infrared satellite images from 1980-2012. Four ITCZ states 28 are defined based on ITCZ location relative to the equator: north (nITCZ) and south 29 (sITCZ) of the equator, simultaneously north and south of the equator (dITCZ, for 30 double), and over the equator (eITCZ). A fifth ITCZ state is used to classify days when 31 no zonally elongated area of cloudiness is present (aITCZ, for absent). The ITCZ states 32 can occur throughout the year (except for the eITCZ, which is not present during June\u201333 October), with the nITCZ state dominating in terms of frequency of occurrence. 34 Interannual variability of the state distribution is large.\r\n35 The most striking variability in ITCZ states is observed in spring. During March-36 April, the dITCZ state occurs on average 34% of the time, second only to the nITCZ state 37 (39%). Composites of observed infrared temperature and precipitation by ITCZ state 38 reveal distinct spatial configurations of cloudiness and rainfall. Strong sea surface 39 temperature anomalies are associated only with eITCZ and sITCZ and they correspond to 40 El Nino and La Nina, respectively. However, all five ITCZ states are associated with 41 distinct atmospheric circulation patterns. A connection is found between the ITCZ and 42 the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), such that activity in the SPCZ is enhanced 43 when the ITCZ is absent in the east Pacific."

      "Factors controlling the accelerated expansion of Imja Lake, Mount Everest region, Nepal"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This study explores the link between area increase of Imja Tsho (Lake) and changes of Imja Glacier (area: ~25km\u00b2) under the influence of climate change using multitemporal satellite imagery and local climate data. Between 1962 and 2013, Imja Lake expanded from 0.03\u00b10.01 to 1.35\u00b10.05 km\u00b2 at a rate of 0.026\u00b10.001 km\u00b2 a\u207b\u00b9. The mean glacier-wide flow velocity was 37\u00b130ma\u207b\u00b9 during 1992\u201393 and 23\u00b115ma\u207b\u00b9 during 2013\u201314, indicating a decreasing velocity. A mean elevation change of \u20131.29\u00b10.71ma\u207b\u00b9 was observed over the lower part of the glacier in the period 2001\u201314, with a rate of \u20131.06\u00b10.63ma\u207b\u00b9 in 2001\u201308 and \u20131.56\u00b10.80ma\u207b\u00b9 in 2008\u201314. We conclude that the decrease in flow velocity is mainly associated with reduced accumulation due to a decrease in precipitation during the last decades. Furthermore, glacier ablation has increased due to increasing maximum temperatures during the post-monsoon months. Decreased glacier flow velocities and increased mass losses induce the formation and subsequent expansion of glacial lakes under favourable topographic conditions."

    ],
    "description": [
      "It has been shown using simulated data that phase estimation of cross-track multibaseline synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric data was most efficiently achieved through a maximum likelihood (ML) method. In this paper, we apply and assess the ML approach on real data, acquired with an experimental Ka-band multibaseline system. Compared to simulated data, dealing with real data implies that several calibration steps be carried out to ensure that the data fit the model. A processing chain was, therefore, designed, including steps responsible for compensating for imperfections observed in the data, such as beam elevation angle dependent phase errors or phase errors caused by imperfect motion compensation. The performance of the ML phase estimation was evaluated by comparing it to results based on a coarse-to-fine (C2F) algorithm, where information from the shorter baselines was used only to unwrap the phase from the longest available baseline. For this purpose, flat areas with high coherence and homogeneous texture were selected in the acquired data. The results show that with only four looks, the noise level was marginally better with the C2F approach and contained fewer outliers. However, with more looks, the ML method consistently delivered better results: noise variance with the C2F approach was slightly but steadily larger than the variance obtained with ML method."

      "Appraisal of adult genitalia after hypospadias repair: Do laypersons mind the difference?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "INTRODUCTION  Men with corrected hypospadias often suffer from sexual inhibition and fear of being ridiculed by others because of their penile appearance. However, no investigation has thus far been made of the perception of hypospadias-affected surgically repaired genitals by laypersons unacquainted with hypospadias. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find out whether laypersons notice a difference between genitals of men with corrected hypospadias in comparison with circumcised genitals. Furthermore, the most relevant predictors of laypersons' perception of hypospadias-affected genitals were examined.  STUDY DESIGN  A cross-sectional study was performed in which a questionnaire with 10 standardized photographs of non-erect hypospadias-affected genitals and 10 circumcised genitals was presented to laypersons unacquainted with hypospadias to measure how they rated these genitals. Laypersons were 105 women and 70 men of three different age groups (age ranges 16-20, 25-30, and 40-45 years). Furthermore, laypersons were asked about demographic characteristics, their sexuality and their genital self-perception.  RESULTS  The results showed that genitals with distal forms of hypospadias were rated similarly to circumcised genitals. In contrast, genitals with more proximal types were perceived as significantly less positive than circumcised genitals. However, the effect size was small. Higher age, being in an intimate relationship, higher socio-economic status, and a higher sexual interest predicted a better layperson's perception of hypospadias-affected genitals.  DISCUSSION  These findings do not support the fear of some men with corrected hypospadias of being ridiculed by others because of their penile appearance. The results indicate that laypersons do not notice a difference between corrected distal types of hypospadias (which represent the majority of hypospadias) and circumcised genitals. Although the findings showed that laypersons perceive more proximal forms of hypospadias less positively than circumcised genitals, the difference does not appear to be clinically relevant as the effect size was small. A major strength of this study is its comprehensive study design. However, the low response rate of hypospadias patients and control individuals for photo documentation and of laypersons who rated these photosets is a limitation of the study. Therefore, generalization from the results must be made carefully.  CONCLUSIONS  The results are relevant for patient counseling. Knowing that the penile appearance would not trouble laypersons may prevent the development of a negative genital self-perception and feelings of shame. The findings also suggest that hypospadias-affected genitals seem to be rated more positively when laypersons know more about the \"normal\" variation of penile appearance (e.g. with increasing sexual experience at a higher age)."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND  Little is known about health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of parents having children with a history of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).  METHODS  This study included 63 mothers and 58 fathers of a cohort of 63 HUS-affected children. At assessment, the mean time since a child experienced an acute episode of HUS was 6.4 years. Parental HRQoL, mental health and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed with standardized self-report questionnaires. Medical data were extracted from patients' hospital records.  RESULTS  The HRQoL and mental health of both the mothers and fathers were not impaired compared to normative data. However, a shorter time since a child's acute HUS episode was a significant predictor of lower HRQoL among the mothers, while no such effect was found among the fathers. Two fathers (3 %), but no mothers, met the criteria for a diagnosis of HUS-related full PTSD; one father (2 %) and four mothers (6 %) met the criteria for a diagnosis of HUS-related partial PTSD.  CONCLUSIONS  Our study shows that most parents of our study sample were doing well in terms of HRQoL and mental health, although a small number met the criteria for full or partial PTSD diagnosis due to their child's HUS. We therefore recommend that healthcare providers pay special attention to parents regarding PTSD symptoms during the clinical follow-up of a HUS-affected child since some parents may benefit from psychological support."

    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVE  To examine emergency department (ED) staff's knowledge of traumatic stress in children, attitudes toward providing psychosocial care, and confidence in doing so, and also to examine differences in these outcomes according to demographic, professional, and organizational characteristics, and training preferences.  STUDY DESIGN  We conducted an online survey among staff in ED and equivalent hospital departments, based on the Psychological First Aid and Distress-Emotional Support-Family protocols. Main analyses involved descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. Respondents were 2648 ED staff from 87 countries (62.2% physicians and 37.8% nurses; mean years of experience in emergency care was 9.5 years with an SD of 7.5 years; 25.2% worked in a low- or middle-income country).  RESULTS  Of the respondents, 1.2% correctly answered all 7 knowledge questions, with 24.7% providing at least 4 correct answers. Almost all respondents (90.1%) saw all 18 identified aspects of psychosocial care as part of their job. Knowledge and confidence scores were associated with respondent characteristics (eg, years of experience, low/middle vs high-income country), although these explained no more than 11%-18% of the variance. Almost all respondents (93.1%) wished to receive training, predominantly through an interactive website or one-off group training. A small minority (11.1%) had previously received training.  CONCLUSIONS  More education of ED staff regarding child traumatic stress and psychosocial care appears needed and would be welcomed. Universal education packages that are readily available can be modified for use in the ED."

      "Pretransplant dyslipidaemia influences primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation"
    ],
    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVES: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a major cause of mortality within the first year following lung transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension, elevated body mass index (BMI), prolonged ischaemic time of the graft, intraoperative blood transfusions >1000 ml and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation increase the risk for PGD. We aimed to evaluate whether dyslipidaemia is an additional risk factor for the development of PGD.\r\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analysed demographic and clinical data of 264 patients who received their first bilateral lung transplantation between March 2000 and October 2013 at our institution. The endpoint was PGD grade 3 at any time, defined according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria. Fasting lipid profiles at listing time or just before transplantation (baseline) were documented and dyslipidaemia was defined as any of the parameters being out of range. Comparisons of continuous variables between patients with PGD grade 3 and patients without were performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test, whereas proportions were compared with the \u03c7(2) test. Continuous variables were presented as arithmetic means with standard deviation for ease of comparison, but levels of statistical significance were computed using the appropriate non-parametric statistical test. To identify PGD risk factors, a forward stepwise logistic regression model was used.\r\nRESULTS: PGD occurred in 63 recipients (24%). Pretransplant dyslipidaemia was documented in 153 recipients (58%) and was significantly more prevalent among recipients developing PGD (45 vs 108, P < 0.013). Despite various underlying pulmonary pathologies, higher triglyceride (TG) levels (1.41 \u00b1 0.78 vs 1.16 \u00b1 0.78, P < 0.012), lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (1.24 \u00b1 0.55 vs 1.57 \u00b1 0.71, P < 0.0005) and higher cholesterol/HDL-C values (3.80 \u00b1 2.02 vs 3.00 \u00b1 0.92, P < 0.0005) were associated with a lower incidence of PGD. Patients with PGD had significantly longer ischaemic time (350 \u00b1 89 vs 322 \u00b1 91, P = 0.017) and higher BMI (23 \u00b1 5 vs 21 \u00b1 4.4, P < 0.007).\r\nCONCLUSION: Dyslipidaemia seems to be an independent risk factor for PGD after lung transplantation: low circulating levels of HDL-C and hypertriglyceridaemia increase the incidence of PGD. Even if HDL-C levels are difficult to alter today, triglyceride and cholesterol levels can be addressed therapeutically and may have a positive influence on the development of PGD."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Big data has now become a strong focus of global interest that is increasingly attracting the attention of academia, industry, government and other organizations. Big data can be situated in the disciplinary area of traditional geospatial data handling theory and methods. The increasing volume and varying format of collected geospatial big data presents challenges in storing, managing, processing, analyzing, visualizing and verifying the quality of data. This has implications for the quality of decisions made with big data. Consequently, this position paper of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Technical Commission II (TC II) revisits the existing geospatial data handling methods and theo- ries to determine if they are still capable of handling emerging geospatial big data. Further, the paper syn- thesises problems, major issues and challenges with current developments as well as recommending what needs to be developed further in the near future."

      "Affective nationalism: Banalities of belonging in Azerbaijan"
    ],
    "description": [
      "While Michael Billig\u2019s \u2018banal nationalism\u2019 points to the significance of the trivial reproduction of national representations in everyday routines, feminist political geographers have highlighted how the nation is brought into being through embodied and emotional practices. Building upon and extending these notions of the nation as represented and embodied, the paper argues that the nation also takes shape through bodily encounters and joyful as well as painful affections. In what we call \u2018affective nationalism\u2019, the nation emerges in moments of encounter between different bodies and objects through embodying, sharing, enjoying or disliking what feels national. We combine a Deleuzian reading of affect that discloses the mechanisms of material becomings with feminist scholarship sensitive to how bodies affect and are affected differently by materially produced nationalisms. Based on ethnographic field research in Azerbaijan, which we present in three vignettes, we untangle the affective becoming of national bodies, objects and places during a publicly staged ceremony of the collective remembrance of martyr and the celebration of a national holiday within the realm of a family. The paper makes two contributions to researching affective nationalism. First, it enquires into how people identify with Azerbaijan through their capacities to affect and to be affected by what feels national and, second, it explores how affective nationalism can be captured through vignettes of affective writing."

      "Older but still fluent? Insights from the intrinsically active baseline configuration of the aging brain using a data driven graph-theoretical approach"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A major part of our knowledge about the functioning of the aging brain comes from task-induced activation paradigms. However, the aging brain's intrinsic functional organization may be already a limiting factor for the outcome of an actual behavior. In order to get a better understanding of how this functional baseline configuration of the aging brain may affect cognitive performance, we analyzed task-free fMRI data of older 186 participants (mean age=70.4, 97 female) and their performance data in verbal fluency: First, we conducted an intrinsic connectivity contrast analysis (ICC) for the purpose of evaluating the brain regions whose degree of connectedness was significantly correlated with fluency performance. Secondly, using connectivity analyses we investigated how the clusters from the ICC functionally related to the other major resting-state networks. Apart from the importance of intact fronto-parietal long-range connections, the preserved capacity of the DMN for a finely attuned interaction with the executive-control network and the language network seems to be crucial for successful verbal fluency performance in older people. We provide further evidence that the right frontal regions might be more prominently affected by age-related decline."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The anticipation of the forthcoming behaviour of social interaction partners is a useful ability supporting interaction and communication between social partners. Associations and prediction based on the production system (in line with views that listeners use the production system covertly to anticipate what the other person might be likely to say) are two potential factors, which have been proposed to be involved in anticipatory language processing. We examined the influence of both factors on the degree to which listeners predict upcoming linguistic input. Are listeners more likely to predict book as an appropriate continuation of the sentence \"The boy reads a\", based on the strength of the association between the words read and book (strong association) and read and letter (weak association)? Do more proficient producers predict more? What is the interplay of these two influences on prediction? The results suggest that associations influence language-mediated anticipatory eye gaze in two-year-olds and adults only when two thematically appropriate target objects compete for overt attention but not when these objects are presented separately. Furthermore, children's prediction abilities are strongly related to their language production skills when appropriate target objects are presented separately but not when presented together. Both influences on prediction in language processing thus appear to be context-dependent. We conclude that multiple factors simultaneously influence listeners' anticipation of upcoming linguistic input and that only such a dynamic approach to prediction can capture listeners' prowess at predictive language processing."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Two studies tested the hypotheses that (1) action orientation (vs. state orientation) is positively correlated with age across adulthood and (2) action orientation aids the self-regulation of one's feelings, thoughts, and behavior during the pursuit of a dieting goal. Hypotheses were partly confirmed. In Study 1, N = 126 overweight women (age: 19\u201377 years) intended to lose weight by means of a low-calorie diet. In Study 2, N = 322 adults (age: 18\u201382 years) reported on their action orientation to replicate the association of age and action orientation found in Study 1. Study 2 corroborated only the expected positive association of age and decision-related action orientation. In Study 1, decision-related action orientation predicted higher affective well-being during the diet as well as less self-reported deviations from the diet; failure-related action orientation predicted lower levels of rumination in response to dieting failures. Action orientation partially mediated the negative effects of age on deviations and rumination (see Hennecke & Freund, 2010). Weight loss was not predicted by action orientation. We discuss action orientation as one factor of increased motivational competence in older adulthood."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article contributes to the study of democratic problems related to governance networks, by focusing on the role of the media. Two main rivalling hypotheses are examined. The functionalist hypothesis postulates that the media accurately inform the public about policy actors and their responsibilities, independent of these actors' institutional status. The media-bias hypothesis postulates an attention bias towards elected policy actors, resulting in reduced public visibility of non-elected policy actors. The analysis uses standardised data on decision-making processes and newspaper content relating to public transport and economic promotion policies in eight western European metropolitan areas. Findings are that the actor mix of governance networks is quite accurately reflected in newspaper reporting. However, elected actors are more often presented as responsible for policies ('over-responsibilised'), and they are more often blamed for policy failures than other actors ('over-blamed'). The extent of this media bias depends on commercial pressure on media outlets. We also show that variations of this general pattern are linked to different types of media systems found across the cases under scrutiny."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The article explores training programs in higher education with regard to data journalism from a multi-national perspective. By carrying out a comparative analysis in six European countries (Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), it covers different models of media systems and journalistic cultures envisaged by Hallin and Mancini. Based on a desk review and in-depth interviews with instructors of data journalism in each country, the article identifies different approaches to the way data journalism is taught. In Europe, such programs are offered by four types of organizations: academic, vocational, professional, and civic. The role played by those organizations can be explained as a result of the peculiarities of national media systems. But there are also commonalities, for example, non-academic institutions (such as the European Journalism Center or the Center for Investigative Journalism) and major international news outlets (such as The Guardian and The New York Times) seem to take over a leading role in all of the analyzed countries. Generally speaking, data journalism education appears to be a very young discipline that frequently neglects fundamental journalistic topics such as ethical issues, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness although they are crucial in a journalistic field as sophisticated tools to reveal hidden aspects of reality."

    ],
    "description": [
      "G-quadruplex (G4)-forming genomic sequences, including telomeres, represent natural replication fork barriers. Stalled replication forks can be stabilized and restarted by homologous recombination (HR), which also repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arising at collapsed forks. We have previously shown that HR facilitates telomere replication. Here, we demonstrate that the replication efficiency of guanine-rich (G-rich) telomeric repeats is decreased significantly in cells lacking HR. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) increases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that G4 formation drives telomere instability. Remarkably, PDS reduces proliferation of HR-defective cells by inducing DSB accumulation, checkpoint activation, and deregulated G2/M progression and by enhancing the replication defect intrinsic to HR deficiency. PDS toxicity extends to HR-defective cells that have acquired olaparib resistance through loss of 53BP1 or REV7. Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively eliminate HR-compromised cells and tumors, including those resistant to PARP inhibition."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This study presents a versatile index for the quantification of hysteretic loops between hydrological variables at the runoff event timescale. The conceptual development of the index is based on a normalization of the input data and the computation of definite integrals at fixed intervals of the independent variable. The sum, the minimum and the maximum of the differences between integrals computed for the rising and the falling curves provide information on the direction, the shape and the extent of the loop. The index was tested with synthetic data and field data from experimental catchments in Northern Italy. Hysteretic relations between streamflow (the independent variable) and soil moisture, depth to water table, isotopic composition and electrical conductivity of stream water (dependent variables) were correctly identified and quantified by the index. The objective quantification of hysteresis by the index allows for the automatic classification of hysteretic loops and thus the determination of differences in hydrological responses during different events. The index was also used to examine the seasonal dynamics in the relation between streamflow and soil moisture and captured the switch in the direction of the loop with changes in event size and antecedent wetness conditions. The sensitivity of the index to the temporal resolution of the measurements and measurement errors was also tested. The index can successfully quantify hysteresis, except for very noisy data or when the temporal resolution of the measurements is not well suited to study hysteresis between the variables."

    ],
    "description": [
      "A \u201clagg\u201d is usually defined as the confined transition zone along the outside margin of a raised bog, characterized by a fen or swamp plant community. It is an important landscape element for biodiversity and helps to maintain a high water table within the peat mass of a bog, but has received little research attention. Greater knowledge of the variability in laggs will improve designation of appropriate conservation sites and restoration of damaged bogs. We therefore examined the hydrological, hydro-chemical, vegetative, and peat characteristics of laggs of bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. The 17 studied lagg transects were classified into four vegetative lagg types: Spiraea Thicket, Carex Fen, Peaty Forest, and Direct Transition. These vegetative lagg types fell within two hydrogeomorphic lagg forms: confined or unconfined. The Spiraea Thicket and Carex Fen laggs were topographically confined at the bog margin and characterized by a higher water table and a smaller tree basal area compared to the unconfined Peaty Forest and Direct Transition laggs. Half of the studied laggs were unconfined, highlighting the importance of considering both confined and unconfined laggs in the delineation, conservation, and restoration of raised bog ecosystems."

      "In this study, the effectiveness of a life skills program to impede tobacco use in early adolescence was scrutinized. The focus was on the mediating role of yielding to peer pressure. The universal school-based life skills program IPSY (Information + Psychosocial Competence = Protection) against adolescent substance use was implemented over 3 years. Over the same time period, it was evaluated based on a longitudinal quasi-experimental design with an intervention and comparison group (4 measurement points; N = 1,657 German students, age 10 at T1). By applying a growth curve modeling approach, we found that participation in IPSY compared with non-participation predicted a slower increase in tobacco use over time, suggesting a significant intervention effect. Moreover, a parallel growth curve model revealed that less yielding to peer pressure induced by IPSY mediated the program effects on tobacco use over time."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Prenatal exposure to infectious or inflammatory insults can increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorder in later life, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. These brain disorders are also characterized by pre- and postsynaptic deficits. Using a well-established mouse model of maternal exposure to the viral mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid [poly(I:C)], we examined whether prenatal immune activation might cause synaptic deficits in the hippocampal formation of pubescent and adult offspring. Based on the widely appreciated role of microglia in synaptic pruning, we further explored possible associations between synaptic deficits and microglia anomalies in offspring of poly(I:C)-exposed and control mothers. We found that prenatal immune activation induced an adult onset of presynaptic hippocampal deficits (as evaluated by synaptophysin and bassoon density). The early-life insult further caused postsynaptic hippocampal deficits in pubescence (as evaluated by PSD95 and SynGAP density), some of which persisted into adulthood. In contrast, prenatal immune activation did not change microglia (or astrocyte) density, nor did it alter their activation phenotypes. The prenatal manipulation did also not cause signs of persistent systemic inflammation. Despite the absence of overt glial anomalies or systemic inflammation, adult offspring exposed to prenatal immune activation displayed increased hippocampal IL-1\u03b2 levels. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that age-dependent synaptic deficits and abnormal pro-inflammatory cytokine expression can occur during postnatal brain maturation in the absence of microglial anomalies or systemic inflammation."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The cellular defense system known as global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) safeguards genome stability by eliminating a plethora of structurally unrelated DNA adducts inflicted by chemical carcinogens, ultraviolet (UV) radiation or endogenous metabolic by-products. Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein provides the promiscuous damage sensor that initiates this versatile NER reaction through the sequential recruitment of DNA helicases and endonucleases, which in turn recognize and excise insulting base adducts. As a DNA damage sensor, XPC protein is very unique in that it (a) displays an extremely wide substrate range, (b) localizes DNA lesions by an entirely indirect readout strategy, (c) recruits not only NER factors but also multiple repair players, (d) interacts avidly with undamaged DNA, (e) also interrogates nucleosome-wrapped DNA irrespective of chromatin compaction and (f) additionally functions beyond repair as a co-activator of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Many recent reports highlighted the complexity of a post-translational circuit that uses polypeptide modifiers to regulate the spatiotemporal activity of this multiuse sensor during the UV damage response in human skin. A newly emerging concept is that stringent regulation of the diverse XPC functions is needed to prioritize DNA repair while avoiding the futile processing of undamaged genes or silent genomic sequences."

    "description": [
      "Does temporary geographical proximity predict learning? Knowledge dynamics in the Olympic Games, Regional Studies. Temporary geographical proximity in the form of face-to-face contact is commonly thought to enhance learning. In a sample of individuals (n = 294) involved in knowledge transfer in the Olympic Games, temporary geographical proximity emerges as a rather weak predictor of learning, although its explanatory value improves when coupled with organized proximity. This association disappears, however, when controlling for other predictors, suggesting that there is no unique effect of temporary geographical proximity on learning. Part of the effect of temporary geographical proximity is mediated through other variables, urging further research into the paths of mediation. Several practical implications for knowledge transfer in mega-events result.\r\n\r\nKann tempor\u00e4re r\u00e4umliche N\u00e4he Lernprozesse vorhersagen?

    "description": [
      "Two studies tested the hypotheses (1) that focusing on the process of goal pursuit is associated with lower levels of procrastination and (2) that this relationship is moderated by fear of failure and task aversiveness. Study 1 used a between-subjects design with hypothetical scenarios (N = 92). Study 2 used a 5-week longitudinal within-subject design in a real-life context (N = 50). Both studies found converging evidence for the main-effect hypothesis, that is, process focus is negatively associated with procrastination in the academic context (e.g., studying for an exam). Process focus was also negatively related to task aversiveness and fear of failure. However, findings regarding moderation effects of fear of failure and task aversiveness were mixed. Taken together, findings support the hypothesis that the cognitive representation of a goal primarily in terms of its means (i.e., process focus) versus its outcome is related to less procrastination: Focusing on the process of a task can help to reduce procrastination."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Recent research on inclusive identities suggests that the highly inclusive superordinate group \u201chumans\u201d is a relevant social category such that identification with all humans is related to various pro-social outcomes. In this research, we tested whether dual identity affects the extent to which the superordinate group humans serves as a relevant comparison standard for relations between developed and developing countries. Overall, participants from a developed country perceived their ingroup as more relatively prototypical for all humanity than people from developing countries. Study 1 revealed that relative prototypicality perceptions predicted weaker behavioral intentions to act against global inequality. In Studies 2 and 3, higher levels of relative prototypicality tended to predict fewer donations and a lower probability to seek fair trade information. Perceived legitimacy of global inequality explained the relation between relative prototypicality and donation behavior (Study 3). Dual identification with both developed countries and humanity did not predict relative prototypicality judgments. We discuss that the social representation of all humans can be a meaningful comparison standard for individuals, and we discuss the role of dual identity in international relations."

All of the five one-week interventions enhanced happiness, three for up to six months (i.e. three funny things, applying humor, and counting funny things), whereas there were only short-term effects on depression (all were effective directly after the intervention). Additionally, we tested the moderating role of indicators of a person \u00d7 intervention-fit and identified early changes in well-being and preference (liking of the intervention) as the most potent indicators for changes six months after the intervention. Overall, we were able to replicate existing work, but also extend knowledge in the field by testing newly developed interventions for the first time. Findings are discussed with respect to the current literature."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present study investigated the functional relevance of gamma oscillations for the processing of rapidly changing acoustic features in speech signals. For this purpose we analyzed repetition-induced perceptual learning effects in 18 healthy adult participants. The participants received either 6Hz or 40Hz tACS over the bilateral auditory cortex, while repeatedly performing a phoneme categorization task. In result, we found that 40Hz tACS led to a specific alteration in repetition-induced perceptual learning. While participants in the non-stimulated control group as well as those in the experimental group receiving 6Hz tACS considerably improved their perceptual performance, the application of 40Hz tACS selectively attenuated the repetition-induced improvement in phoneme categorization abilities. Our data provide causal evidence for a functional relevance of gamma oscillations during the perceptual learning of acoustic speech features. Moreover, we demonstrate that even less than twenty minutes of alternating current stimulation below the individual perceptual threshold is sufficient to affect speech perception. This finding is relevant in that this novel approach might have implications with respect to impaired speech processing in dyslexics and older adults."

      "Getting More From Visual Working Memory: Retro-Cues Enhance Retrieval and Protect From Visual Interference"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Visual working memory (VWM) has a limited capacity. This limitation can be mitigated by the use of focused attention: if attention is drawn to the relevant working memory content before test, performance improves (the so-called retro-cue benefit). This study tests 2 explanations of the retro-cue benefit: (a) Focused attention protects memory representations from interference by visual input at test, and (b) focusing attention enhances retrieval. Across 6 experiments using color recognition and color reproduction tasks, we varied the amount of color interference at test, and the delay between a retrieval cue (i.e., the retro-cue) and the memory test. Retro-cue benefits were larger when the memory test introduced interfering visual stimuli, showing that the retro-cue effect is in part because of protection from visual interference. However, when visual interference was held constant, retro-cue benefits were still obtained whenever the retro-cue enabled retrieval of an object from VWM but delayed response selection. Our results show that accessible information in VWM might be lost in the processes of testing memory because of visual interference and incomplete retrieval. This is not an inevitable state of affairs, though: Focused attention can be used to get the most out of VWM. (PsycINFO Database Record"

      "Integrative DNA methylome analysis of pan-cancer biomarkers in cancer discordant monozygotic twin-pairs"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: A key focus in cancer research is the discovery of biomarkers that accurately diagnose early lesions in non-invasive tissues. Several studies have identified malignancy-associated DNA methylation changes in blood, yet no general cancer biomarker has been identified to date. Here, we explore the potential of blood DNA methylation as a biomarker of pan-cancer (cancer of multiple different origins) in 41 female cancer discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs sampled before or after diagnosis using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.\r\nRESULTS: We analysed epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 41 cancer discordant MZ twin-pairs with affected individuals diagnosed with tumours at different single primary sites: the breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, thyroid gland, skin (melanoma), ovary, and pancreas. No significant global differences in whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed. Epigenome-wide analyses identified one novel pan-cancer differentially methylated position at false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10\u00a0% (cg02444695, P\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7)) in an intergenic region 70\u00a0kb upstream of the SASH1 tumour suppressor gene, and three suggestive signals in COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Replication of the four top-ranked signals in an independent sample of nine cancer-discordant MZ twin-pairs showed a similar direction of association at COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340, and significantly greater methylation discordance at AXL compared to 480 healthy concordant MZ twin-pairs. The effects at cg02444695 (near SASH1), COL11A2, and LINC00340 were the most promising in biomarker potential because the DNA methylation differences were found to pre-exist in samples obtained prior to diagnosis and were limited to a 5-year period before diagnosis. Gene expression follow-up at the top-ranked signals in 283 healthy individuals showed correlation between blood methylation and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines at PRL, and in the skin tissue at AXL. A significant enrichment of differential DNA methylation was observed in enhancer regions (P\u2009=\u20090.03).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified DNA methylation signatures in blood associated with pan-cancer, at or near SASH1, COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Three of these signals were present up to 5\u00a0years prior to cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential clinical utility of whole blood DNA methylation analysis in cancer surveillance."

    "description": [
      "The usually negative relationship between school bonds and juvenile delinquency implies that adolescents with strong ties to school are less likely to engage in delinquency. Still, it is not always clear whether the impact of school bonds on delinquency is direct or mediated by other, more proximate causes. This article examines the dynamic interrelations between social bonds and the acceptance of legal norms over the course of adolescence. Results reveal that school bonds directly affect the acceptance of legal norms, but not delinquency. However, norms are directly and reciprocally related to delinquency. Therefore, school bonds can be considered an indirect preventive factor for delinquent behavior. Moreover, the closely related school bond and norm dimensions share a common developmental pattern during adolescence."

      "The etiology of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unexplained: biological, psychological and social factors must be considered. This study examined if differences in HPA-axis activity already exist in those who do not yet fulfill IBS criteria (i.e. \"subthreshold IBS\"). We also investigated whether there were differences between those who reported clinically relevant (i.e. distressing) IBS symptoms and those who did not. Thirty-six women were subdivided into three groups (IBS group, subthreshold IBS group, control group). Results showed differences in morning cortisol levels (U\u00a0=\u00a011.58; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with IBS patients showing a lower cortisol response compared to controls. Subthreshold IBS patients were comparable to controls regarding endocrine function. Diurnal cortisol levels did not differ between groups. Group comparisons between distressed subjects and non-distressed subjects regarding cortisol levels did not reach significance. The finding of endocrine abnormalities (at least in a sub-set of patients) is important since these might be associated with deficient pain processing in IBS."

      "The effects of advanced monitoring on hemodynamic management in critically ill patients: a pre and post questionnaire study"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In critically ill patients, many decisions depend on accurate assessment of the hemodynamic status. We evaluated the accuracy of physicians' conventional hemodynamic assessment and the impact that additional advanced monitoring had on therapeutic decisions. Physicians from seven European countries filled in a questionnaire in patients in whom advanced hemodynamic monitoring using transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO system; Pulsion Medical Systems SE, Feldkirchen, Germany) was going to be initialized as part of routine care. The collected information included the currently proposed therapeutic intervention(s) and a prediction of the expected transpulmonary thermodilution-derived variables. After transpulmonary thermodilution measurements, physicians recorded any changes that were eventually made in the original therapeutic plan. A total of 315 questionnaires pertaining to 206 patients were completed. The mean difference (\u00b1standard deviation; 95\u00a0% limits of agreement) between estimated and measured hemodynamic variables was -1.54 (\u00b12.16; -5.77 to 2.69) L/min for the cardiac output (CO), -74 (\u00b1235; -536 to 387) mL/m(2) for the global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI), and -0.5 (\u00b15.2; -10.6 to 9.7) mL/kg for the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI). The percentage error for the CO, GEDVI, and EVLWI was 66, 64, and 95\u00a0%, respectively. In 54\u00a0% of cases physicians underestimated the actual CO by more than 20\u00a0%. The information provided by the additional advanced monitoring led 33, 22, 22, and 13\u00a0% of physicians to change their decisions about fluids, inotropes, vasoconstrictors, and diuretics, respectively. The limited clinical ability of physicians to correctly assess the hemodynamic status, and the significant impact that more physiological information has on major therapeutic decisions, support the use of advanced hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients."

      "On the use and usefulness of backup plans"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In this article, we introduce the concept of backup plans as a motivational construct, defined as alternative means to an end that are intentionally developed but are not initially (or ever) used. We posit that backup plans change the way that a person pursues a goal, as well as the likelihood of achieving it, even if the backup plans are never used. In some cases, backup plans are a safety net supporting goal pursuit; however, in other cases, they constitute an unnecessary expense that can undermine motivation to persist with a first-choice plan. We propose that variations in the use and usefulness of backup plans are based on a person\u2019s estimation and regulation of complexity value, or the additional costs and benefits that having a backup plan introduces compared with pursuing the same goal with only a single means. Although variations in the estimation and regulation of complexity value are idiosyncratic products of individual, contextual, and goal-related factors, we provide the prototypical example of age-related differences to illustrate our key points. In sum, our conceptualization of backup plans represents a new synthesis of motivation, multiple-goal, and life-span developmental research that addresses a key lacuna in the self-regulation literature."

    ],
    "description": [
      "We tested the effectiveness of a self-administered online positive psychology intervention which addressed the appreciation of beauty and excellence on happiness and depression directly after the intervention, after one week, and one, three, and six months. One hundred thirteen adults were randomly assigned to a \u201c9 beautiful things\u201d intervention (IG; n = 59), or a placebo control group (\u201cearly memories\u201d; n = 54). Participants in the IG were asked to write down (a) three beautiful things in human behavior; (b) three things they experienced as beautiful in nature and/or the environment; and (c) three beautiful things related to beauty in general that they observed. Findings show increased levels of happiness in the intervention group at post-test, after one week and one month, and amelioration of depressive symptoms at the post-test and one week after the intervention. The effect sizes were small to medium (\u03b72 = .03 to .07). Overall, this initial study provides support for the notion that the \u201c9 beautiful things\u201d intervention may be effective in increasing people's well-being\u2014at least in a short term."

The associations between brain activity, cognitive and emotional change, and outcome were analysed in 21 patients.ResultsPatients showed enhanced activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum compared with the control group. Non-response to therapy was associated with enhanced activity in the right amygdala compared with those who responded, and activity in this region was negatively associated with outcome. Emotional but not cognitive changes mediated this association.ConclusionsAmygdala hyperactivity may lessen symptom improvement in psychotherapy for depression through attenuating emotional skill acquisition."

      "Attitudes of Austrian veterinarians towards euthanasia in small animal practice: impacts of age and gender on views on euthanasia"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Background Euthanasia of pets has been described by veterinarians as \u201cthe best and the worst\u201d of the profession. The most commonly mentioned ethical dilemmas veterinarians face in small animal practice are: limited treatment options due to financial constraints, euthanizing of healthy animals and owners wishing to continue treatment of terminally ill animals. The aim of the study was to gain insight into the attitudes of Austrian veterinarians towards euthanasia of small animals. This included assessing their agreement with euthanasia in exemplified case scenarios, potentially predicted by demographic variables (e.g. gender, age, working in small animal practice, employment, working in a team, numbers of performed euthanasia). Further describing the veterinarians\u2019 agreement with a number of different normative and descriptive statements, including coping strategies. A questionnaire with nine euthanasia scenarios, 26 normative and descriptive statements, and demographic data were sent to all members of the Austrian Chamber of Veterinary Surgeons (n\u2009=\u20092478).\r\nResults In total, 486 veterinarians answered sufficiently completely to enable analyses. Responses were first explored descriptively before being formally analysed using linear regression and additive Bayesian networks \u2013 a multivariate regression methodology \u2013 in order to identify joint relationships between the demographic variables, the statements and each of the nine euthanasia scenarios. Mutual dependencies between the demographic variables were found, i.e. female compared to male veterinarians worked mostly in small animal practice, and working mostly in small animal practice was linked to performing more euthanasia per month.\r\nConclusions Gender and age were found to be associated with views on euthanasia: female veterinarians and veterinarians having worked for less years were more likely to disagree with euthanasia in at least some of the convenience euthanasia scenarios. The number of veterinarians working together was found to be the variable with the highest number of links to other variables, demographic as well as ethical statements. This highlights the role of a team potentially providing support in stressful situations. The results are useful for a better understanding of coping strategies for veterinarians with moral stress due to euthanasia of small animals."

      "A single-blinded, randomized clinical trial of how to implement an evidence-based treatment for generalized anxiety disorder [IMPLEMENT] - effects of three different strategies of implementation"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Despite long-standing calls to disseminate evidence-based treatments for generalized anxiety (GAD), modest progress has been made in the study of how such treatments should be implemented. The primary objective of this study was to test three competing strategies on how to implement a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for out-patients with GAD (i.e., comparison of one compensation vs. two capitalization models).\r\nMETHODS: For our three-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (implementation of CBT for GAD [IMPLEMENT]), we recruited adults with GAD using advertisements in high-circulation newspapers to participate in a 14-session cognitive behavioral treatment (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry, MAW-packet). We randomly assigned eligible patients using a full randomization procedure (1:1:1) to three different conditions of implementation: adherence priming (compensation model), which had a systematized focus on patients' individual GAD symptoms and how to compensate for these symptoms within the MAW-packet, and resource priming and supportive resource priming (capitalization model), which had systematized focuses on patients' strengths and abilities and how these strengths can be capitalized within the same packet. In the intention-to-treat population an outcome composite of primary and secondary symptoms-related self-report questionnaires was analyzed based on a hierarchical linear growth model from intake to 6-month follow-up assessment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02039193) and is closed to new participants.\r\nFINDINGS: From June 2012 to Nov. 2014, from 411 participants that were screened, 57 eligible participants were recruited and randomly assigned to three conditions. Forty-nine patients (86%) provided outcome data at post-assessment (14% dropout rate). All three conditions showed a highly significant reduction of symptoms over time. However, compared with the adherence priming condition, both resource priming conditions indicated faster symptom reduction. The observer ratings of a sub-sample of recorded videos (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) showed that the therapists in the resource priming conditions conducted more strength-oriented interventions in comparison with the adherence priming condition. No patients died or attempted suicide.\r\nINTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first trial that focuses on capitalization and compensation models during the implementation of one prescriptive treatment packet for GAD. We have shown that GAD related symptoms were significantly faster reduced by the resource priming conditions, although the limitations of our study included a well-educated population. If replicated, our results suggest that therapists who implement a mental health treatment for GAD might profit from a systematized focus on capitalization models.\r\nFUNDING: Swiss Science National Foundation (SNSF-Nr.

      "Eliminating dual-task costs by minimizing crosstalk between tasks: The role of modality and feature pairings"
    ],
    "description": [
      "We tested the independent influences of two content-based factors on dual-task costs, and on the parallel processing ability: The pairing of S-R modalities and the pairing of relevant features between stimuli and responses of two tasks. The two pairing factors were realized across four dual-task groups. Within each group the two tasks comprised two different stimulus modalities (visual and auditory), two different relevant stimulus features (spatial and verbal) and two response modalities (manual and vocal). Pairings of S-R modalities (standard: visual-manual and auditory-vocal, non-standard: visual-vocal and auditory-manual) and feature pairings (standard: spatial-manual and verbal-vocal, non-standard: spatial-vocal and verbal-manual) varied across groups. All participants practiced their respective dual-task combination in a paradigm with simultaneous stimulus onset before being transferred to a psychological refractory period paradigm varying stimulus-onset asynchrony. A comparison at the end of practice revealed similar dual-task costs and similar pairing effects in both paradigms. Dual-task costs depended on modality and feature pairings. Groups training with non-standard feature pairings (i.e., verbal stimulus features mapped to spatially separated response keys, or spatial stimulus features mapped to verbal responses) and non-standard modality pairings (i.e., auditory stimulus mapped to manual response, or visual stimulus mapped to vocal responses) had higher dual-task costs than respective standard pairings. In contrast, irrespective of modality pairing dual-task costs virtually disappeared with standard feature pairings after practice in both paradigms. The results can be explained by crosstalk between feature-binding processes for the two tasks. Crosstalk was present for non-standard but absent for standard feature pairings. Therefore, standard feature pairings enabled parallel processing at the end of practice."

    ],
    "description": [
      "INTRODUCTION: Certain sexual health problems in men can be attributed to genital self-image. Therefore, a culturally adapted version of a Male Genital Self-Image Scale (MGSIS) could help health professionals understand this concept and its associated correlates.\r\nAIM: To translate the original English version of the MGSIS into Persian and to assess the psychometric properties of this culturally adapted version (MGSIS-I) for use in Iranian men.\r\nMETHODS: In total, 1,784 men were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Backward and forward translations of the MGSIS were used to produce the culturally adapted version. Reliability of the MGSIS-I was assessed using Cronbach \u03b1 and intra-class correlation coefficients. Divergent and convergent validities were examined using Pearson correlation and known-group validity was assessed in subgroups of participants with different sociodemographic statuses. Factor validity of the scale was investigated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.\r\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information, the International Index of Erectile Function, the Body Appreciation Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the MGSIS.\r\nRESULTS: Mean age of participants was 38.13 years (SD\u00a0= 11.45) and all men were married. Cronbach \u03b1 of the MGSIS-I was 0.89 and interclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.70 to 0.94. Significant correlations were found between the MGSIS-I and the International Index of Erectile Function (P < .01), whereas correlation of the scale with non-similar scales was lower than with similar scale (confirming convergent and divergent validity). The scale could differentiate between subgroups in age, smoking status, and income (known-group validity). A single-factor solution that explained 70% variance of the scale was explored using exploratory factor analysis (confirming uni-dimensionality); confirmatory factor analysis indicated better fitness for the five-item version than the seven-item version of the MGSIS-I (root mean square error of approximation\u00a0= 0.05, comparative fit index > 1.00 vs root mean square error of approximation\u00a0= 0.10, comparative fit index > 0.97, respectively).\r\nCONCLUSION: The MGSIS-I is a useful instrument to assess genital self-image in Iranian men, a concept that has been associated with sexual function. Further investigation is needed to identify the applicability of the scale in other cultures or populations."

      "Happy heart syndrome: role of positive emotional stress in takotsubo syndrome"
    ],
    "description": [
      "AIMS: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is typically provoked by negative stressors such as grief, anger, or fear leading to the popular term 'broken heart syndrome'. However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional trigger. Of these, 4.1% (n = 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9% (n = 465) with unequivocal negative emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with 'happy heart syndrome' was similar to those with the 'broken heart syndrome' including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5% (17/19) vs. 90.2% (412/457), P = 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. However, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in 'happy hearts' compared with 'broken hearts' (35.0 vs. 16.3%, P = 0.030).\r\nCONCLUSION: Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient characteristics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the 'happy hearts' than among the 'broken hearts'. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This paper shows that assemblage thinking and actor-network theory (ANT) have much more to gain from each other than debate has so far conceded. Exploring the conjunctions and disjunctions between the two approaches, it proposes three cross-fertilisations that have implications for understanding three key processes in our socio-material world: stabilisation, change and affect. First, the conceptual vocabulary of ANT can enrich assemblage thinking with an explicitly spatial account of the ways in which assemblages are drawn together, reach across space and are stabilised. Second, each approach is better attuned to conceptualising a particular kind of change in socio-material relations: ANT describes change without rupture, or fluidity, whereas assemblage thinking describes change with rupture, or events. Third and last, assemblage thinking could fashion ANT with a greater sensitivity for the productive role of affect in bringing socio-material relations into being through the production of desire/wish (d\u00e9sir). We demonstrate the implications of these cross-fertilisations for empirical work through a case study of the global market for assisted reproduction."

      "Attentional Bias towards Positive Emotion Predicts Stress Resilience"
    ],
    "description": [
      "There is extensive evidence for an association between an attentional bias towards emotionally negative stimuli and vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology. Less is known about whether selective attention towards emotionally positive stimuli relates to mental health and stress resilience. The current study used a modified Dot Probe task to investigate if individual differences in attentional biases towards either happy or angry emotional stimuli, or an interaction between these biases, are related to self-reported trait stress resilience. In a nonclinical sample (N = 43), we indexed attentional biases as individual differences in reaction time for stimuli preceded by either happy or angry (compared to neutral) face stimuli. Participants with greater attentional bias towards happy faces (but not angry faces) reported higher trait resilience. However, an attentional bias towards angry stimuli moderated this effect: The attentional bias towards happy faces was only predictive for resilience in those individuals who also endorsed an attentional bias towards angry stimuli. An attentional bias towards positive emotional stimuli may thus be a protective factor contributing to stress resilience, specifically in those individuals who also endorse an attentional bias towards negative emotional stimuli. Our findings therefore suggest a novel target for prevention and treatment interventions addressing stress-related psychopathology."

      "Broadening perspectives on trauma and recovery: a socio-interpersonal view of PTSD"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the very few mental disorders that requires by definition an environmental context-a traumatic event or events-as a precondition for diagnosis. Both trauma sequelae and recovery always occur in the context of social-interpersonal contexts, for example, in interaction with a partner, family, the community, and the society. The present paper elaborates and extends the social-interpersonal framework model of PTSD. This was developed to complement other intrapersonally focused models of PTSD, which emphasize alterations in an individual's memory, cognitions, or neurobiology. Four primary reasons for broadening the perspective from the individual to the interpersonal-societal contexts are discussed. The three layers of the model (social affects, close relationships, and culture and society) are outlined. We further discuss additional insights and benefits of the social-interpersonal perspective for the growing field of research regarding resilience after traumatic experiences. The paper closes with an outlook on therapy approaches and interventions considering this broader social-interpersonal perspective on PTSD."

      "The present study explores the role of personality, ability, and affect in a randomized, group-based positive psychology intervention program based on Seligman\u2019s authentic happiness theory and extensions. A total of 100 adults (M = 45.7, SD = 12.8) were randomly assigned to the 12-week intervention program (five training sessions) or a waiting list control group. The intervention consisted of basic information, group activities, and homework assignments. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of happiness, pleasure, and engagement after completion of the program. Baseline levels of psychometric intelligence moderated the intervention effectiveness (greater effects for those higher in reasoning, vocabulary, and general intelligence). There were no effects for the big five personality traits. Finally, increases in positive affect before and after the homework assignment were associated with greater levels of happiness after the program. The relevance of these findings for the development of new programs is discussed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Aim: To provide a mechanistic and probabilistic framework for defining the species pool based on species-specific probabilities of dispersal, environmental suitability and biotic interactions within a specific temporal extent, and to show how probabilistic species pools can help disentangle the geographical structure of different community assembly processes.\r\nInnovation: Probabilistic species pools provide an improved species pool definition based on probabilities in conjunction with the associated species list, which explicitly recognize the indeterminate nature of species pool membership for a given focal unit of interest and better capture real-world complexity. Probabilistic species pools provide a quantitative assessment of how dispersal, environmental or biotic factors influence estimates of species pool composition and size for a given temporal extent.\r\nConclusions: Based on one simulated and two empirical examples we demonstrate that probabilistic species pools allow us to disentangle the geographical variation in dispersal, environmental and biotic assembly processes for species assemblages in focal units. We also show that probabilistic species pools are fully compatible with traditional definitions of species pools and are applicable over a wide range of spatial and temporal extents. Additionally they are robust to missing data and provide a quantified and transparent approach to estimating the size and composition of species pools in a mechanistic way, providing a valuable tool for studies from community ecology to macroecology."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Geographically structured phenotypic selection can lead to adaptive divergence. However, in flowering plants, such divergent selection has rarely been shown, and selection on floral signals is generally little understood. In this study, we measured phenotypic selection on display size, floral color, and floral scent in four lowland and four mountain populations of the nectar-rewarding terrestrial orchid Gymnadenia odoratissima in two years. We also quantified population differences in these traits and pollinator community composition. Our results show positive selection on display size and positive, negative, or absence of selection on different scent compounds and floral color. Selection on the main scent compounds was consistently stronger in the lowlands than in the mountains, and lowland plants emitted higher amounts of most of these compounds. Pollinator community composition also differed between regions, suggesting different pollinators select for differences in floral volatiles. Overall, our study is the first to document consistent regional differences in selection on floral scent, suggesting this pattern of selection is one of the evolutionary forces contributing to regional divergence in floral chemical signaling."

This article details and applies the concept of measurement invariance within a cross-nationally comparative context. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis is used to test configural, metric, and scalar invariance in an empirical example and structural equation modeling introduces exogenous predictors of Internet use types. Results support metric invariance for a four-factor Internet usage model in three English-speaking countries. The significance of measurement invariance testing for unbiased comparative research is discussed."

The reply (Martin 2015, On the challenges of measuring humor styles: Response to Heintz and Ruch. Humor: International Journal of Humor Research 28. 635\u2013639) suggested that our study could be methodologically flawed, thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. In the present reply, we discuss each of these criticisms and demonstrate that these are likely unfounded and do not influence our results and conclusions. Thus we still suggest that the gap between the conceptualization and the measurement of humor styles should be closed to improve the construct validity of the HSQ. This would allow interpreting the manifold findings with the HSQ and deriving hypotheses for future studies based on the humor style constructs."

    "description": [
      "Whereas research on civic engagement with a European or North American focus usually assumes that a culture of participation thrives in healthy political and economic surroundings, the validity of this proposition has been questioned in the Latin American context. Instead, existing literature suggests that disadvantageous political and economic conditions spur participation in Latin America. In contrast to previous studies that investigate development and engagement with a focus on a specific local or national context in Latin America, this article takes a broad comparative perspective to test whether this\u2014at first glance\u2014counterintuitive result holds for the whole region. Multilevel analysis of 21 Central and South American countries corroborates the inverse association between development and engagement previously observed in selected countries. Further insights show that particularly affluent individuals and those who are rather comfortable with national and local politics are civically engaged in economically adverse contexts."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Reduced integrity of white matter (WM) pathways and subtle anomalies in gray matter (GM) morphology have been hypothesized as mechanisms in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, findings on structural brain changes in early stages after mTBI are inconsistent and findings related to early symptoms severity are rare. Fifty-one patients were assessed with multimodal neuroimaging and clinical methods exclusively within 7 days following mTBI and compared to 53 controls. Whole-brain connectivity based on diffusion tensor imaging was subjected to network-based statistics, whereas cortical surface area, thickness, and volume based on T1-weighted MRI scans were investigated using surface-based morphometric analysis. Reduced connectivity strength within a subnetwork of 59 edges located predominantly in bilateral frontal lobes was significantly associated with higher levels of self-reported symptoms. In addition, cortical surface area decreases were associated with stronger complaints in five clusters located in bilateral frontal and postcentral cortices, and in the right inferior temporal region. Alterations in WM and GM were localized in similar brain regions and moderately-to-strongly related to each other. Furthermore, the reduction of cortical surface area in the frontal regions was correlated with poorer attentive-executive performance in the mTBI group. Finally, group differences were detected in both the WM and GM, especially when focusing on a subgroup of patients with greater complaints, indicating the importance of classifying mTBI patients according to severity of symptoms. This study provides evidence that mTBI affects not only the integrity of WM networks by means of axonal damage but also the morphology of the cortex during the initial post-injury period. These anomalies might be greater in the acute period than previously believed and the involvement of frontal brain regions was consistently pronounced in both findings. The dysconnected subnetwork suggests that mTBI can be conceptualized as a dysconnection syndrome. It remains unclear whether reduced WM integrity is the trigger for changes in cortical surface area or whether tissue deformations are the direct result of mechanical forces acting on the brain. The findings suggest that rapid identification of high-risk patients with the use of clinical scales should be assessed acutely as part of the mTBI protocol."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The concept of attention has a prominent place in cognitive psychology. Attention can be directed not only to perceptual information, but also to information in working memory (WM). Evidence for an internal focus of attention has come from the retro-cue effect: Performance in tests of visual WM is improved when attention is guided to the test-relevant contents of WM ahead of testing them. The retro-cue paradigm has served as a test bed to empirically investigate the functions and limits of the focus of attention in WM. In this article, we review the growing body of (behavioral) studies on the retro-cue effect. We evaluate the degrees of experimental support for six hypotheses about what causes the retro-cue effect: (1)\u2009Attention protects representations from decay, (2)\u2009attention prioritizes the selected WM contents for comparison with a probe display, (3)\u2009attended representations are strengthened in WM, (4)\u2009not-attended representations are removed from WM, (5)\u2009a retro-cue to the retrieval target provides a head start for its retrieval before decision making, and (6)\u2009attention protects the selected representation from perceptual interference. The extant evidence provides support for the last four of these hypotheses."

      "Effect of Aging on ERP Components of Cognitive Control"
    ],
    "description": [
      "As people age, their performance on tasks requiring cognitive control often declines. Such a decline is frequently explained as either a general or specific decline in cognitive functioning with age. In the context of hypotheses suggesting a general decline, it is often proposed that processing speed generally declines with age. A further hypothesis is that an age-related compensation mechanism is associated with a specific cognitive decline. One prominent theory is the compensation hypothesis, which proposes that deteriorated functions are compensated for by higher performing functions. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) in the context of a GO/NOGO task to examine the age-related changes observed during cognitive control in a large group of healthy subjects aged between 18 and 84 years. The main question we attempted to answer was whether we could find neurophysiological support for either a general decline in processing speed or a compensation strategy. The subjects performed a relatively demanding cued GO/NOGO task with similar omissions and reaction times across the five age groups. The ERP waves of cognitive control, such as N2, P3cue and CNV, were decomposed into latent components by means of a blind source separation method. Based on this decomposition, it was possible to more precisely delineate the different neurophysiological and psychological processes involved in cognitive control. These data support the processing speed hypothesis because the latencies of all cognitive control ERP components increased with age, by 8 ms per decade for the early components (<200 ms) and by 20 ms per decade for the late components. At the same time, the compensatory hypothesis of aging was also supported, as the amplitudes of the components localized in posterior brain areas decreased with age, while those localized in the prefrontal cortical areas increased with age in order to maintain performance on this simple task at a relatively stable level."

      "Dark chocolate attenuates intracellular pro-inflammatory reactivity to acute psychosocial stress in men: a randomized controlled trial"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Flavanol-rich dark chocolate consumption relates to lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, but underlying mechanisms are elusive. We investigated the effect of acute dark chocolate consumption on inflammatory measures before and after stress. Healthy men, aged 20-50 years, were randomly assigned to a single intake of either 50g of flavanol-rich dark chocolate (n=31) or 50 g of optically identical flavanol-free placebo-chocolate (n=34). Two hours after chocolate intake, both groups underwent the 15-min Trier Social Stress Test. We measured DNA-binding-activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB-BA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as plasma and whole blood mRNA-levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, prior to chocolate intake before and several times after stress cessation. We also repeatedly measured the flavanol epicatechin and the stress hormones epinephrine and cortisol in plasma and saliva, respectively. Compared to the placebo-chocolate-group, the dark-chocolate-group revealed a marginal increase in IL-10 mRNA prior to stress (p=.065), and a significantly blunted stress reactivity of NF-\u03baB-BA, IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, and IL-6 mRNA (p's\u2a7d.036) with higher epicatechin levels relating to lower pro-inflammatory stress reactivity (p's\u2a7d.033). Stress hormone changes to stress were controlled. None of the other measures showed a significant chocolate effect (p's\u2a7e.19). Our findings indicate that acute flavanol-rich dark chocolate exerts anti-inflammatory effects both by increasing mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and by attenuating the intracellular pro-inflammatory stress response. This mechanism may add to beneficial effects of dark chocolate on cardiovascular health."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Aging is usually accompanied by alterations of cognitive control functions such as conflict processing. Recent research suggests that aging effects on cognitive control seem to vary with degree and source of conflict, and conflict specific aging effects on performance measures as well as neural activation patterns have been shown. However, there is sparse information whether and how aging affects different stages of conflict processing as indicated by event related potentials (ERPs) such as the P2, N2 and P3 components. In the present study, 19 young and 23 elderly adults performed a combined Flanker conflict and stimulus-response-conflict (SRC) task. Analysis of the reaction times (RTs) revealed an increased SRC related conflict effect in elderly. ERP analysis furthermore demonstrated an age-related increase of the P2 amplitude in response to the SRC task. In addition, elderly adults exhibited an increased P3 amplitude modulation induced by incongruent SRC and Flanker conflict trials."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Emotional stimuli have been shown to modulate attentional orienting through signals sent by subcortical brain regions that modulate visual perception at early stages of processing. Fewer studies, however, have investigated a similar effect of emotional stimuli on attentional orienting in the auditory domain together with an investigation of brain regions underlying such attentional modulation, which is the general aim of the present study. Therefore, we used an original auditory dot-probe paradigm involving simultaneously presented neutral and angry non-speech vocal utterances lateralized to either the left or the right auditory space, immediately followed by a short and lateralized single sine wave tone presented in the same (valid trial) or in the opposite space as the preceding angry voice (invalid trial). Behavioral results showed an expected facilitation effect for target detection during valid trials while functional data showed greater activation in the middle and posterior superior temporal sulci (STS) and in the medial frontal cortex for valid vs. invalid trials. The use of reaction time facilitation [absolute value of the Z-score of valid-(invalid+neutral)] as a group covariate extended enhanced activity in the amygdalae, auditory thalamus, and visual cortex. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of a large and distributed network of regions among which the STS, thalamus, and amygdala are crucial for the decoding of angry prosody, as well as for orienting and maintaining attention within an auditory space that was previously primed by a vocal emotional event."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Black carbon (BC) is a byproduct of combustion from wildfires and fossil fuels and is a slow-cycling component of the carbon cycle. Whether BC accumulates and ages on millennial timescales in the world oceans has remained unknown. Here, we quantified dissolved BC (DBC) in marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) isolated by solid phase extraction (SPE) at several sites in the world ocean. We find that DBC in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans ranges from 1.4 to 2.6\u2009\u03bcM in the surface and is 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u03bcM in the deep Atlantic. The average \u00b9\u2074C age of surface DBC is 4,800\u2009\u00b1\u2009620 \u00b9\u2074C yrs, and much older in a deep water sample (23,000\u2009\u00b1\u20093,000 \u00b9\u2074C yrs). The range of DBC structures and \u00b9\u2074C ages indicates that DBC is not homogeneous in the ocean. We show that there are at least two distinct pools of marine DBC, a younger pool that cycles on centennial timescales and an ancient pool that cycles on >10\u2075\u2009year timescales."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present study introduces a revised Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, a new conceptualization and operationalization of the resilience indicator SOC. It outlines the scale development and aims for testing its reliability, factor structure, and validity. Literature on Antonovsky\u2019s SOC (SOC-A) was critically reviewed to identify needs for improving the scale. The scale was investigated in two samples. Sample 1 consisted of 334 bereaved participants, Sample 2 of 157 healthy controls. The revised SOC Scale, SOC-A, and theoretically relevant questionnaires were applied. Explorative and confirmatory factor analyses established a three-factor structure in both samples. The revised SOC Scale showed significant but discriminative associations with related constructs, including self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth, and neuroticism. The revised measure was significantly associated with psychological health indicators, including persistent grief, depression, and anxiety, but not to the extent as the previous SOC-A. Stability over time was sufficient. The study provides psychometric support for the revised SOC conceptualization and scale. It has several advantages over the previous SOC-A scale (unique variance, distinct factor structure, stability). The scale could be used for clinical and health psychological testing or research into the growing field of studies on resilience over the life span."

In contrast to transcribed conversations, monologues are interspersed throughout the book, acting like small, performative interruptions. The lively juxtaposition of both individual speech and colloquy is enhanced by theatrical conventions: characters enter and exit; stage directions mirror those found in the cabaret."

      "Age patterns in mental representations of time: underlying constructs and relevant covariates"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Background/Study Context: Research suggests that mental representations of time encompass multiple distinct aspects that vary with age, but prior studies rarely assessed more than one aspect of time perception and did not systematically consider relevant covariates. This lack of integration across studies hampers theory building and limits a deeper understanding of underlying constructs. Methods: Five widely used and conceptually distinct measures of time perception (i.e., perceived life position, global future horizons, future orientation and planning, self-continuity, and the temporal extension of episodic future thought) were administered to a demographically stratified adult life-span sample. Theoretically implicated covariates, including cognition, current affect, personality, and subjective health, were also assessed. Results: Principle component analyses suggested a four-component solution. Perceived life position and global future horizons formed a single component reflecting subjective life span; the remaining measures each constituted separate components. The life span component and episodic future thought were negatively associated with age, self-continuity was positively associated with age, and future orientation did not vary by age. Among the covariates, mental and physical health showed the most pronounced associations with time perceptions, but the direction of effects varied across components. Conclusion: Findings suggest that mental representations of time encompass multiple components that show distinct age patterns and associations with covariates. Implications for theory building and practical applications are discussed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Although perceived continuity with one\u2019s future self has attracted increasing research interest, age differences in this phenomenon remain poorly understood. The present study is the first to simultaneously examine past and future self-continuity across multiple temporal distances using both explicit and implicit measures and controlling for a range of theoretically implicated covariates in an adult life span sample (N = 91, aged 18\u201392, M = 50.15, SD = 19.20, 56% female). Perceived similarity to one\u2019s self across 6 past and 6 future time points (1 month to 10 years) was assessed with an explicit self-report measure and an implicit me/not me trait rating task. In multilevel analyses, age was significantly associated with greater implicit and explicit self-continuity, especially for more distant intervals. Further, reaction times (RTs) in the implicit task remained stable with temporal distance for older adults but\r\ndecreased with temporal distance for younger adults, especially for future ratings. This points toward age differences in the underlying mechanisms of self-continuity. Multilevel models examined the role of various covariates including personality, cognition, future horizons, and subjective health and found that none of them could fully account for the observed age effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that chronological age is associated with greater self-continuity although specific mechanisms and correlates\r\nmay vary by age."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Weedy plants affect the biodiversity and ecosystem function as well as the crop and fodder plant production. However, adequate management requires detailed knowledge of the taxonomic identity of these plants. Here, we focused on a hemiparasitic Pedicularis species (Orobanchaceae), which occurs at high densities and results in significant biomass reductions in forage grasses in Bayanbulak Grassland of Xinjiang. The identity of this target species is not clear, with conflicting reports in publications and in herbarium collections. Hence, clear and management-relevant information on demography and reproductive ecology is difficult to be obtained from the literature. Therefore, we analyzed field and archival materials collected from Xinjiang in order to clarify the identity and distribution of the target species. Morphological analyses suggested that the populations at Bayanbulak Grassland should be Pedicularis kansuensis Maxim. rather than P. verticillata L. which has been accepted in the available literature. Phylogenetic analysis with a combination of three barcodes (matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA) uniting a clade of P. kansuensis and individuals from Bayanbulak Grassland populations with 100% bootstrap support, confirmed the target species to be P. kansuensis. Anatomical investigations and field observations showed that the target species is an annual or biennial herb, which also fits with the life cycle as P. kansuensis. Based on archive material and field observations, we verified that the distribution of P. kansuensis is mainly concentrated in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In previous studies, the incorporation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been quantified in the accumulation areas of Alpine glaciers. Here, we introduce a model framework that quantifies mass fluxes of PCBs in glaciers and apply it to the Silvretta glacier (Switzerland). The models include PCB incorporation into the entire surface of the glacier, downhill transport with the flow of the glacier ice, and chemical fate in the glacial lake. The models are run for the years 1900\u22122100 and validated by comparing modeled and measured PCB concentrations in an ice core, a lake sediment core, and the glacial streamwater. The incorporation and release fluxes, as well as the storage of PCBs in the glacier increase until the 1980s and decrease thereafter. After a\r\ntemporary increase in the 2000s, the future PCB release and the PCB concentrations in the glacial stream are estimated to be small but persistent throughout the 21st century. This study quantifies all relevant PCB fluxes in and from a temperate Alpine glacier over two centuries, and concludes that Alpine glaciers are a small secondary source of PCBs, but that the aftermath of\r\nenvironmental pollution by persistent and toxic chemicals can endure for decades."

      "Virgin soil in irony research: Personality, humor, and the \u201csense of irony\u201d"
    ],
    "description": [
      "he aim of the paper is fourfold: (a) show why humor scholars should study irony, (b) explore the need for considering interindividual differences in healthy adults\u2019 irony performance, (c) stress the necessity for developing tools assessing habitual differences in irony performance, and (d) indicate future directions for joint irony and humor research and outline possible applications. Verbal irony is often employed with a benevolent humorous intent by speakers, but can also serve as a means of disparagement humor. In both cases, encoding and decoding activities entailing irony need to be considered in the context of the psychology of humor. We argue that verbal irony performance can be considered a phenomenon native to the realm of humor and individual differences. We point out that research has widely neglected the meaningfulness of variance in irony performance within experimental groups when looking at determinants of irony detection and production. Based on theoretical considerations and previous empirical findings we show that this variance can be easily related to individual-differences variables such as the sense of humor, dispositions toward laughter and ridicule (e.g., gelotophobia), and general mental ability. Furthermore, we hypothesize that there is an enduring trait determining irony performance we will label the sense of irony. The sense of irony possibly goes along with inclinations toward specific affective and cognitive processing patterns when dealing with verbal irony. As an application, novel irony performance tests can help to study psychological and neurophysiological correlates of irony performance more feasibly, that is, in nonclinical groups."

      "Amino acid change in an Orchid desaturase enables mimicry of the pollinator\u2019s sex pheromone"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Mimicry illustrates the power of selection to produce phenotypic convergence in biology [1]. A striking example is the imitation of female insects by plants that are pollinated by sexual deception of males of the same insect species [2-4]. This involves mimicry of visual, tactile, and chemical signals of females [2-7], especially their sex pheromones [8-11]. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys exaltata employs chemical mimicry of cuticular hydrocarbons, particularly the 7-alkenes, in an insect sex pheromone to attract and elicit mating behavior in its pollinators, males of the cellophane bee Colletes cunicularius [11-13]. A difference in alkene double-bond positions is responsible for reproductive isolation between O. exaltata and closely related species, such as O. sphegodes [13-16]. We show that these 7-alkenes are likely determined by the action of the stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase (SAD) homolog SAD5. After gene duplication, changes in subcellular localization relative to the ancestral housekeeping desaturase may have allowed proto-SAD5's reaction products to undergo further biosynthesis to both 7- and 9-alkenes. Such ancestral coproduction of two alkene classes may have led to pollinator-mediated deleterious pleiotropy. Despite possible evolutionary intermediates with reduced activity, amino acid changes at the bottom of the substrate-binding cavity have conferred enzyme specificity for 7-alkene biosynthesis by preventing the binding of longer-chained fatty acid (FA) precursors by the enzyme. This change in desaturase function enabled the orchid to perfect its chemical mimicry of pollinator sex pheromones by escape from deleterious pleiotropy, supporting a role of pleiotropy in determining the possible trajectories of adaptive evolution."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Although a large body of literature indicates that interparental discord is a primary risk factor for child maladjustment, less research has examined children's behavior as a predictor of the parents' relationship quality. The goal of this randomized trial intervention study was to examine the effects of improved problem behavior in children on the parents' relationship quality 1 year later in a community sample. One hundred couples were randomly assigned to (a) a parenting training (Triple P) or (b) an untreated control group. Interparental relationship quality, parenting behavior, and child problem behavior were assessed by means of questionnaires completed by the parents before and 2 weeks after completion of the treatment and at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Mother-report of improved child problem behavior and father-report of improved parenting skills predicted both partners' relationship quality at the 1-year follow-up for the Triple P group only. The findings suggest that programs aimed at reducing child problem behavior hold promise to also enhance the couple's relationship quality. (PsycINFO Database Record"

    ],
    "description": [
      "Although virtually all experts agree that CO2 emissions are causing anthropogenic global warming, public discourse is replete with contrarian claims that either deny that global warming is happening or dispute a human influence. Although the rejection of climate science is known to be driven by ideological, psychological, and political factors rather than scientific disagreement, contrarian views have considerable prominence in the media. A better understanding of contrarian discourse is therefore called for. We report a blind expert test of contrarian claims about climatological variables. Expert economists and statisticians were presented with representative contrarian statements (e.g., \u201cArctic ice is recovering\u201d) translated into an economic or demographic context. In that blind test, contrarian claims were found to be misleading. By contrast, mainstream scientific interpretations of the data were judged to be accurate and policy relevant. The results imply that media inclusion of contrarian statements may increase bias rather than balance."

      "Positive Psychology Interventions Addressing Pleasure, Engagement, Meaning, Positive Relationships, and Accomplishment Increase Well-Being and Ameliorate Depressive Symptoms: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Online Study"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Seligman (2002) suggested three paths to well-being, the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of meaning, and the pursuit of engagement, later adding two more, positive relationships and accomplishment, in his 2011 version. The contribution of these new components to well-being has yet to be addressed. In an online positive psychology intervention study, we randomly assigned 1624 adults aged 18\u201378 (M = 46.13; 79.2% women) to seven conditions. Participants wrote down three things they related to either one of the five components of Seligman\u2019s Well-Being theory (Conditions 1\u20135), all of the five components (Condition 6) or early childhood memories (placebo control condition). We assessed happiness (AHI) and depression (CES-D) before and after the intervention, and 1-, 3-, and 6 months afterwards. Additionally, we considered moderation effects of well-being levels at baseline. Results confirmed that all interventions were effective in increasing happiness and most ameliorated depressive symptoms. The interventions worked best for those in the middle-range of the well-being continuum. We conclude that interventions based on pleasure, engagement, meaning, positive relationships, and accomplishment are effective strategies for increasing well-being and ameliorating depressive symptoms and that positive psychology interventions are most effective for those people in the middle range of the well-being continuum."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Botanists and plant morphologists have long been fascinated by how certain species can exhibit such reduced morphologies that even their identification to genus- or family-level becomes difficult. Such was the case with Lysipomia mitsyae sp. nov., an exceptionally small plant discovered in the Peruvian Andes which bears lobelioid characteristics but differs in size by an order of magnitude from the current smallest members known from the entire Campanulaceae and lacks diagnostic characters allowing it to be reliably placed to genus-level. Molecular analyses of trnL-F, composed of a representative Lobelioideae sampling, place the samples within the genus Lysipomia, requiring that amendments be made to the description of the genus. Supplementary ITS analyses of a representative generic sampling indicate a close relationship to Lysipomia sphagnophila and L. multiflora. We here describe the world's smallest Campanulaceae, Lysipomia mitsyae sp. nov., and discuss its phylogenetic and systematic relationships to the other members of the genus. Its highly reduced morphology, which has given it status as the smallest Campanulaceae and, quite possibly, the world's smallest eudicot, is discussed in the light of current knowledge on the physiological and anatomical constraints on alpine plant growth and survival."

    "description": [
      "This paper aims to advance our knowledge of the relationships between emotions, affect, and geopolitics. For, among several criticisms of affect\u2019s non-representational theories, is the claim that it has not been used to understand problems of real social and political importance. What is crucially lacking in this important body of work on the nexus between affect and politics is empirically grounded research that examines these processes, especially in situations of geopolitical instability and conflict. In this paper, I seek to address this gap by attending to the geopolitical role of feelings in the volatile political climate of a post-conflict city. Specifically, my work examines the emotional and affective landscapes of daily life in the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina which, twenty years after the war officially ended, continues to experience divisions between its Croat/Catholic and Bosniak/Muslim populations."

      "We study the differential impact of large exchange rate devaluations on the cost of living at different points on the income distribution. Across product categories, the poor have relatively high expenditure shares in tradeable products. Within tradeable product categories, the poor consume lower-priced varieties. Changes in the relative price of tradeables and the relative prices of lower-priced varieties following a devaluation will affect the cost of the consumption basket of the low-income households relative that of the high-income households. We quantify these effects following the 1994 Mexican peso devaluation and show that their distributional consequences can be large. In the two years that follow the devaluation, the cost of the consumption basket of those in the bottom decile of the income distribution rose between 1.46 and 1.6 times more than the cost of the consumption basket for the top income decile."

      "Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is a collective term for carbon-rich residues comprised of a continuum of products arising from biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion. PyC is ubiquitous in the environment where it can be transported by wind and water before being deposited in aquatic sediments. We compare results from four different methods used to trace PyC that were applied to a high-temporal resolution sedimentary record in order to constrain changes in PyC concentrations and fluxes over the past ~250 years. We find markedly discordant records for different PyC tracers, particularly during the pre-industrial age, implying different origins and modes of supply of sedimentary PyC. In addition to providing new insights into the composition of sedimentary combustion products, this study reveals that elucidation of past combustion processes, and development of accurate budgets of PyC production and deposition on local to regional scales requires careful consideration of both source characteristics and transport processes."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Fire-derived, pyrogenic carbon (PyC), sometimes called black carbon (BC), is the carbonaceous solid residue of biomass and fossil fuel combustion, such as char and soot. PyC is ubiquitous in the environment due to its long persistence, and its abundance might even increase with the projected increase in global wildfire activity and the continued burning of fossil fuel. PyC is also increasingly produced from the industrial pyrolysis of organic wastes, which yields charred soil amendments (biochar). Moreover, the emergence of nanotechnology may also result in the release of PyC-like compounds to the environment. It is thus a high priority to reliably detect, characterize and quantify these charred materials in order to investigate their environmental properties and to understand their role in the carbon cycle. Here, we present the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method, which allows the simultaneous assessment of PyC's characteristics, quantity and isotopic composition (13C and 14C) on a molecular level. The method is applicable to a very wide range of environmental sample materials and detects PyC over a broad range of the combustion continuum, i.e., it is sensitive to slightly charred biomass as well as high temperature chars and soot. The BPCA protocol presented here is simple to employ, highly reproducible, as well as easily extendable and modifiable to specific requirements. It thus provides a versatile tool for the investigation of PyC in various disciplines, ranging from archeology and environmental forensics to biochar and carbon cycling research."

      "Flood volume estimation in Switzerland using synthetic design hydrographs - a multivariate statistical approach"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Accurate estimations of flood peaks, volumes and hydrographs are needed to design safe and cost-effective hydraulic structures. In this study, we propose a statistical approach for the estimation of the design variables peak and volume by constructing a synthetic design hydrograph. Our approach is based on fitting probability density functions to observed flood hydrographs and takes the dependence between the two variables peak and volume into account. The method consists of the following six steps: sampling of flood events, baseflow separation, normalization of the hydrographs, fitting of the hydrography with statistical density functions, modeling of peak and volume considering their dependence, and construction of the synthetic design hydrograph. The method was developed and tested based on data from nine meso-scale catchments in Switzerland, and has been shown to provide reliable synthetic design hydrographs for all of these catchments. While the method has so far been applied to gauged catchments, it is foreseen to make it applicable to engaged catchments using regionalization approaches."

      "Independent component processes underlying emotions during natural music listening"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the brain processes underlying emotions during natural music listening. To address this, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from 22 subjects while presenting a set of individually matched whole musical excerpts varying in valence and arousal. Independent component analysis was applied to decompose the EEG data into functionally distinct brain processes. A k-means cluster analysis calculated on the basis of a combination of spatial (scalp topography and dipole location mapped onto the Montreal Neurological Institute brain template) and functional (spectra) characteristics revealed 10 clusters referring to brain areas typically involved in music and emotion processing, namely in the proximity of thalamic-limbic and orbitofrontal regions as well as at frontal, fronto-parietal, parietal, parieto-occipital, temporo-occipital and occipital areas. This analysis revealed that arousal was associated with a suppression of power in the alpha frequency range. On the other hand, valence was associated with an increase in theta frequency power in response to excerpts inducing happiness compared to sadness. These findings are partly compatible with the model proposed by Heller, arguing that the frontal lobe is involved in modulating valenced experiences (the left frontal hemisphere for positive emotions) whereas the right parieto-temporal region contributes to the emotional arousal."

      "Cortical thinning in the anterior cingulate cortex predicts multiple sclerosis patients' fluency performance in a lateralised manner"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Cognitive impairment is as an important feature of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and might be even more relevant to patients than mobility restrictions. Compared to the multitude of studies investigating memory deficits or basic cognitive slowing, executive dysfunction is a rarely studied cognitive domain in MS, and its neural correlates remain largely unexplored. Even rarer are topological studies on specific cognitive functions in MS. Here we used several structural MRI parameters - including cortical thinning and T2 lesion load - to investigate neural correlates of executive dysfunction, both on a global and a regional level by means of voxel- and vertex-wise analyses. Forty-eight patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 48 healthy controls participated in the study. Five executive functions were assessed, i.e. verbal and figural fluency, working memory, interference control and set shifting. Patients scored lower than controls in verbal and figural fluency only, and displayed widespread cortical thinning. On a global level, cortical thickness independently predicted verbal fluency performance, when controlling for lesion volume and central brain atrophy estimates. On a regional level, cortical thinning in the anterior cingulate region correlated with deficits in verbal and figural fluency and did so in a lateralised manner: Left-sided thinning was related to reduced verbal - but not figural - fluency, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for right-sided thinning. We conclude that executive dysfunction in MS patients can specifically affect verbal and figural fluency. The observed lateralised clinico-anatomical correlation has previously been described in brain-damaged patients with large focal lesions only, for example after stroke. Based on focal grey matter atrophy, we here show for the first time comparable lateralised findings in a white matter disease with widespread pathology."

      "Effects of an awareness raising campaign on intention and behavioural determinants for handwashing"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This article assesses the effectiveness of The Great WASH Yatra handwashing awareness raising campaign in India on changing visitors' intention to wash hands with soap after using the toilet and the underlying behavioural determinants. Interviews based on the RANAS (Risk, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, Self-regulation) model of behaviour change were conducted with 687 visitors before and after their visit to the campaign. Data showed that a campaign visit had little effect on the intention to wash hands with soap, even when comparing visitors who had actively participated in handwashing games with those who had not. After a campaign visit, knowledge about the benefits of washing hands had increased by almost half a standard deviation. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that when considering all behavioural determinants change scores simultaneously, they were able to explain 57% of the variance in the intention change score. These findings suggest that substantively changing behaviour requires more than improving knowledge and emphasizing the importance of washing hands. Identifying the crucial behavioural determinants for handwashing may be an important first step in planning effective large-scale promotion programmes."

      "Multi-domain training enhances attentional control"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Multi-domain training potentially increases the likelihood of overlap in processing components with transfer tasks and everyday life, and hence is a promising training approach for older adults. To empirically test this, 84 healthy older adults aged 64 to 75 years were randomly assigned to one of three single-domain training conditions (inhibition, visuomotor function, spatial navigation) or to the simultaneous training of all three cognitive functions (multi-domain training condition). All participants trained on an iPad at home for 50 training sessions. Before and after the training, and at a 6-month follow-up measurement, cognitive functioning and training transfer were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery including tests targeting the trained functions (near transfer) and transfer to executive functions (far transfer: attentional control, working memory, speed). Participants in all four training groups showed a linear increase in training performance over the 50 training sessions. Using a latent difference score model, the multi-domain training group, compared with the single-domain training groups, showed more improvement on the far transfer attentional control composite. Individuals with initially lower baseline performance showed higher training-related improvements, indicating that training compensated for lower initial cognitive performance. At the 6-month follow-up, performance on the cognitive test battery remained stable. This is one of the first studies to investigate systematically multi-domain training including comparable single-domain training conditions. Our findings suggest that multi-domain training enhances attentional control involved in handling several different tasks at the same time, an aspect in everyday life that is particularly challenging for older people.

    "description": [
      "What distinguishes the Socrates of the early from the Socrates of the middle dialogues? According to a well-known opinion, the \u201cdividing line\u201d lies in the difference between the Socratic and the Platonic theory of action. Whereas for the Platonic Socrates of the early dialogues, all desires are good-dependent, for the Platonic Socrates of the middle dialogues, there are good-independent desires. The paper argues first (I) that this \u201cdividing line\u201d is blurred in the \"Symposium\", and second (II) that we have in the \"Symposium\" a more distinctive dividing line, namely the introduction of the separate existence of the idea of beauty. This introduction by Diotima/Plato of separate ideas and the lack of (noetic) understanding of separate ideas \u2013 here the idea of beauty \u2013 by Socrates may have been the limit not only of the Socrates of the early Platonic dialogues, but of the historical Socrates as well."

      "A century of geometry and velocity evolution at Eqip Sermia, West Greenland"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Rapid dynamic changes of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers of the Greenland ice sheet are related to atmospheric and oceanic warming but the detailed link to external forcing is not well understood. Observations show high variability in dynamic changes and are mainly limited to the past three decades with dense satellite observations. Here we compile a long-term record of dynamic changes of Eqip Sermia Glacier,West Greenland. Starting in 1912, we combine historical measurements of terminus positions, ice-surface elevation and flow velocity together with more recent in-situ and remote-sensing observations. In the 20th century, the glacier underwent small variations in terminus position and flow speed. Between 2000 and 2003, the terminus retreated substantially, but stabilized thereafter. In 2009, the northern terminus lobe started to retreat very rapidly; the southern lobe collapsed in 2013. The present terminus position, which has retreated by 4 km since 1920, is unprecedented in the historical record. Flow velocities were relatively stable until 2010. The recent acceleration reached threefold velocities in 2014 and rapidly affected the whole terminus region up to 15 km inland. Comparison with forcings from the atmosphere and the ocean over the past century shows that no dominant cause can be identified, and that local effects of bed geometry modulate the glacier response."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Background Compared to blood or urine, drugs can be detected for much longer periods in the long hair of horses. The aim of this study was to establish and validate a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the detection and quantification of frequently prescribed opioids, sedatives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the mane and tail hair of horses. Based on an average growth rate of about 2 cm per month, times of administration reported by horse owners or veterinary physicians were related to drug localizations in hair. Hair samples were collected from ten horses that received drug treatments and analyzed in segments of 2, 4 or 6 cm in length. Hair segments were decontaminated, cut into fragments and methanol-extracted under sonication. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for 13 commonly used drugs using the validated procedure. Deuterated analogs were included as internal standards. Results Analytes were detected in hair samples with a length of up to 70 cm. Fourteen out of 16 hair samples were positive for at least one of the tested drugs. Segmentation allowed for time-resolved monitoring of periods of 1 to 3 months of drug administration. Concentrations in dark hair reached a maximum of 4.0 pg/mg for butorphanol, 6.0 pg/mg for tramadol, 1.4 pg/mg for morphine, 1.8 pg/mg for detomidine, 1.2 pg/mg for acepromazine, 39 pg/mg for flunixin, 5.0 pg/mg for firocoxib, and 3\u2019600 pg/mg for phenylbutazone. Only trace amounts of meloxicam were detected. Drug detection correlated well with the reported period of medical treatment. No analytes were detected in the light-colored mane and tail hair samples from one horse despite preceding administrations of acepromazine and phenylbutazone. Conclusion This study describes a sensitive and selective technique suitable for the validated detection and quantification of frequently prescribed veterinary drugs in horse hair. The segmental method can be applied for time-resolved long-term retrospective drug monitoring, for example in prepurchase examinations of horses as drug detection in hair can prove preceding medical treatments."

      "Effect of a Primary Care Management Intervention on Mental Health-Related Quality of Life Among Survivors of Sepsis: A Randomized Clinical Trial"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Importance\r\nSurvivors of sepsis face long-term sequelae that diminish health-related quality of life and result in increased care needs in the primary care setting, such as medication, physiotherapy, or mental health care.\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo examine if a primary care-based intervention improves mental health-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\r\nRandomized clinical trial conducted between February 2011 and December 2014, enrolling 291 patients 18 years or older who survived sepsis (including septic shock), recruited from 9 intensive care units (ICUs) across Germany.\r\n\r\nInterventions\r\nParticipants were randomized to usual care (n\u2009=\u2009143) or to a 12-month intervention (n\u2009=\u2009148). Usual care was provided by their primary care physician (PCP) and included periodic contacts, referrals to specialists, and prescription of medication, other treatment, or both. The intervention additionally included PCP and patient training, case management provided by trained nurses, and clinical decision support for PCPs by consulting physicians.\r\n\r\nMain Outcomes and Measures\r\nThe primary outcome was change in mental health-related quality of life between ICU discharge and 6 months after ICU discharge using the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36 [range, 0-100; higher ratings indicate lower impairment; minimal clinically important difference, 5 score points]).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe mean age of the 291 patients was 61.6 years (SD, 14.4); 66.2% (n\u2009=\u2009192) were men, and 84.4% (n\u2009=\u2009244) required mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay (median duration of ventilation, 12 days [range, 0-134]). At 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, 75.3% (n\u2009=\u2009219 [112 intervention, 107 control]) and 69.4% (n\u2009=\u2009202 [107 intervention, 95 control]), respectively, completed follow-up. Overall mortality was 13.7% at 6 months (40 deaths [21 intervention, 19 control]) and 18.2% at 12 months (53 deaths [27 intervention, 26 control]). Among patients in the intervention group, 104 (70.3%) received the intervention at high levels of integrity. There was no significant difference in change of mean MCS scores (intervention group mean at baseline, 49.1; at 6 months, 52.9; change, 3.79 score points [95% CI, 1.05 to 6.54] vs control group mean at baseline, 49.3; at 6 months, 51.0; change, 1.64 score points [95% CI, -1.22 to 4.51]; mean treatment effect, 2.15 [95% CI, -1.79 to 6.09]; P\u2009=\u2009.28).\r\n\r\nConclusions and Relevance\r\nAmong survivors of sepsis and septic shock, the use of a primary care-focused team-based intervention, compared with usual care, did not improve mental health-related quality of life 6 months after ICU discharge. Further research is needed to determine if modified approaches to primary care management may be more effective."

      "Crisis Politics in Europe: why Austerity Is Easier to Implement in Some Countries Than in Others"
    ],
    "description": [
      "When countries face balance-of-payments crises, their policy responses vary widely. This article argues that the choice between the two main options of internal adjustment (i.e., austerity and structural reforms) and external adjustment (i.e., exchange-rate devaluation) depends on how costly each of these strategies is for a country overall. Although the choice of adjustment strategy is thus structurally determined, the level of political conflict associated with crisis management depends on both the national vulnerability profile and partisan interests. Moreover, irrespective of the adjustment strategy, all governments design the specific reforms in ways that shelter their own voters. Empirically, this article uses qualitative case studies and survey data to examine the significant variation in crisis responses, crisis politics, and distributive outcomes of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis in eight Eastern European countries. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the Eastern European experience for crisis politics in the Eurozone crisis."

      "Character evolution and the origin of Caimaninae (Crocodylia) in the New World Tropics: new evidence from the Miocene of Panama and Venezuela"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Alligators and caimans share a close relationship, supported by both molecular and morphological characters. The divergence between alligators and caimans has been difficult to discern in the fossil record. Two basal taxa have recently been described from the Miocene of Panama and Venezuela but have not yet been presented in a joint phylogeny. Continued preparation of the type material of the Venezuelan Globidentosuchus brachyrostris Scheyer et al., 2013 has revealed new characters for scoring in a cladistic framework. In addition, the first lower jaw of the Panamanian Centenariosuchus gilmorei Hastings et al., 2013 is described herein, and additional characters were scored. In total, we conducted five cladistic analyses to better understand the character evolution involved in the establishment of Caimaninae. In each case, Globidentosuchus appears as the basal-most of the caimanine lineage, followed by Culebrasuchus mesoamericanus Hastings et al., 2013 from Panama. Stepwise character additions of synapomorphies define progressively more derived caimanines, but stratigraphic context creates ghost lineages extending from the Miocene to Paleocene. The persistence of two basal taxa into the Miocene of northern South America and Central America supports the concept of a relict basal population in this region. This further supports biogeographic hypotheses of dispersals in both directions between North and South America prior to full land connection."

      "Incented Voluntary Municipal Mergers as a Two-Stage Process: Evidence from the Swiss Canton of Fribourg"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Voluntary mergers of local jurisdictions in Europe gained in importance in the last two decades. A debated but rarely analyzed issue in this field is the impact of different local characteristics on the probability to merge. The paper contributes to this debate by assessing the importance of local determinants in two stages of a merger process. The quantitative study of a large-scale territorial reform in the Swiss canton of Fribourg shows that factors linked to the functional dimension of local government, such as economic hardship, explain the start of a merger process but not the decision taken at the ballots. Here, factors associated with the political dimension of local government, such as political power considerations, offer a better explanation. These findings might be explained by the variation of different political actors\u2019 strength along the two stages of a merger process."

      "Australasian temperature reconstructions spanning the last millennium"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Multiproxy  warm season  (September\u2013February) temperature reconstructions are  presented for the  combined land\u2013ocean region of Australasia (0\u00ba\u201350\u00baS, 110\u00baE\u2013180\u00ba) covering 1000\u20132001. Using between  2 (R2) and 28 (R28) paleoclimate records, four 1000-member ensemble reconstructions of regional temperature are developed using four statistical methods: principal component regression (PCR), composite plus scale (CPS), Bayesian hierarchical models (LNA), and pairwise comparison (PaiCo). The reconstructions are then compared with a three-member ensemble of GISS-E2-R climate model simulations  and independent paleoclimate records. Decadal fluctuations  in Australasian temperatures are remarkably similar between the four reconstruction methods. There are, however, differences in the amplitude of temperature variations  between  the different  statistical  methods  and proxy networks.  When the R28 network is used, the warmest 30-yr periods occur after 1950 in 77% of ensemble members over all methods. However, reconstructions based on only the longest records (R2 and R3 networks) indicate that single 30- and 10-yr periods of similar or slightly higher temperatures than in the late twentieth century may have occurred during the first half of the millennium. Regardless, the most recent instrumental temperatures (1985\u20132014) are above the 90th percentile of all 12 reconstruction ensembles  (four reconstruction methods  based on three proxy networks\u2014R28, R3, and R2). The reconstructed twentieth-century warming cannot be explained  by natural variability alone using GISS-E2-R. In this climate model, anthropogenic forcing is required to produce the rate and magnitude of post-1950 warming observed in the Australasian region. These paleoclimate results are consistent  with other studies that attribute the post-1950 warming in Australian temperature records to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations."

      "Neural correlates of mindful self-awareness in mindfulness meditators and meditation-na\u00efve subjects revisited"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Mindful self-awareness is central to mindfulness meditation and plays a key role in its salutary effects. It has been related to decreased activation in cortical midline structures (CMS) and amygdala, and increased activation in somatosensory regions. However, findings in untrained individuals are contradictory, and scarce in experienced meditators. Using fMRI, we investigated experienced mindfulness meditators (LTM, n=21, average 4652 practice-hours) and matched meditation-na\u00efve participants (MNP, n=19) during short periods of mindful self-awareness (FEEL) and self-referential thinking (THINK). We report somatosensory activations and decreases in CMS during FEEL for both groups, but significantly stronger decreases in prefrontal CMS in LTM. LTM further showed decreases in language-related and amygdala regions, but the latter was not significantly different between groups. Overall, higher activations in amygdala and mid-line regions during FEEL were related to levels of depressiveness. Neural patterns of mindful self-awareness emerge already in MNP but more pronounced in LTM. Specifically, meditation training might reduce self-reference and verbalization during mindful awareness. We further corroborate the suggested link between mindfulness and healthy self-related functions on the neural level. Longitudinal studies need to corroborate these findings."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Despite beneficial effects of minority members\u2019 contact with majority members, studies have repeatedly shown minorities\u2019 tendency of having predominantly intraethnic social contacts, a phenomenon called ethnic homophily. This study aimed at examining ethnic homophily among mothers belonging to minority groups in Germany and Israel. Mothers from four minority groups participated. Groups were defined by level of societal segregation (higher vs. lower residential and cultural segregation of minority groups within a given society) and cultural distance to the majority society (close vs. distant in terms of religion and value similarity with majority population). We expected group differences, with ethnic homophily being highest among minority mothers living in more segregated societies with a large cultural distance to the majority population and vice versa. We also expected within-group variation, with higher levels of homophily being reported by women who use the majority language less frequently, have lower orientations toward natives, have higher orientations toward their own minority, and perceive higher levels of discrimination. The total sample included 1,223 mothers (ethnic German diaspora repatriates and Turks in Germany, Russian Jewish diaspora migrants, and Arabs in Israel). We assessed homophily in strong and weak social network ties. Results revealed the highest homophily (for weak and strong ties) among Israeli Arab mothers and lowest among ethnic German diaspora repatriate mothers with the two other groups located in between the two. Use of majority language emerged as rather universal predictor related to both outcomes in all minority groups, whereas minority and majority orientations were outcome or group specific, respectively."

      "Elevational diversity patterns as an example for evolutionary and ecological dynamics in ferns and lycophytes"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Evolutionary processes such as adaptation, ecological filtering, and niche conservatism involve the interaction of organisms with their environment and are thus commonly studied along environmental gradients. Elevational gradients have become among the most studied environmental gradients to understand large-scale patterns of species richness and composition because they are highly replicated with different combinations of geographical, environmental and historical factors. We here review the literature on using elevational gradients to understand evolutionary processes in ferns. Some phylogenetic studies of individual fern clades have considered elevation in the analysis or interpretation and postulated that fern diversification is linked to the colonization of mountain habitats. Other studies that have linked elevational community composition and hence ecological filtering with phylogenetic community composition and morphological traits, usually only found limited phylogenetic signal. However, these studies are ultimately only correlational, and there are few actual tests of the evolutionary mechanisms leading to these patterns. We identify a number of challenges for improving our understanding of how evolutionary and ecological processes are linked to elevational richness patterns in ferns: i) limited information on traits and their ecological relevance, ii) uncertainties on the dispersal kernels of ferns and hence the delimitation of regional species pools from which local assemblages are recruited, iii) limited genomic data to identify candidate genes under selection and hence actually document adaptation and selection, and iv) conceptual challenges in developing clear and testable hypotheses to how specific evolutionary processes can be linked to patterns in community composition and species richness."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND  Neutrophils and monocytes are crucial for controlling bacterial infections. More-frequent bacterial infections are accordingly encountered in neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy. This is not the case for pegylated interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1)-induced neutropenia. We hypothesized that IFN-\u03b1 induces a compensatory innate antibacterial state that prevents bacterial infections despite the neutropenia.  METHODS  To investigate whether patients with hepatitis C virus infection treated with IFN-\u03b1 killed group A Streptococcus (GAS) better than before initiating therapy, whole blood was used to perform ex vivo GAS killing assays before, during, and after IFN-\u03b1 therapy.  RESULTS  We found that IFN-\u03b1 therapy enhanced GAS killing in whole blood ex vivo despite the decreased neutrophil and monocyte numbers during IFN-\u03b1 therapy. IFN-\u03b1 also boosted neutrophil- and monocyte-mediated GAS killing in vitro. Underlying mechanisms included increased production of the antibacterial properdin, a regulator of the complement activation, as well as reactive oxygen species.  CONCLUSIONS  These findings help to explain the rather discrepant facts of neutropenia but preserved antibacterial immune defenses in patients treated with IFN-\u03b1."

      "Living with intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism: a qualitative analysis of interviews with paediatric patients and their parents"
    ],
    "description": [
      "INTRODUCTION  Progress in diagnosis and treatment of patients with intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM) such as urea cycle disorders, organic acidurias or maple syrup urine disease is resulting in a growing number of long-term survivors. Consequently, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of patients is increasingly regarded as a meaningful outcome parameter. To develop the first validated, disease-specific HrQoL questionnaire for IT-IEM, patients and parents were interviewed as content experts to identify major physical and psychosocial constraints and resources.  METHODS  Focus group interviews with 19 paediatric IT-IEM patients and 26 parents were conducted in four metabolic centres in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Disease-specific HrQoL categories were established by qualitative content analysis.  RESULTS  Fourteen disease-specific topics related to the three well-established generic HrQoL dimensions of physical, mental and social functioning were derived from the interview transcripts. Both patients and parents perceived dietary restrictions and social stigmatisation as major burdens. Dietary restrictions and emotional burdens were more important for young (<8 years) patients, whereas cognition, fatigue and social issues were more relevant to older patients (\u22658 years). Treatment-related topics had a significant effect on social and emotional HrQoL.  DISCUSSION  By exploring patients' and parents' perspectives, 14 HrQoL categories were identified. These new categories will allow the development of a disease-specific, standardised questionnaire to assess HrQoL in paediatric IT-IEM patients. Age-appropriate information on the disease and psychosocial support targeted to patients' individual burdens are essential to the delivery of personalised care that takes account of physical, mental and social dimensions of HrQoL."

      "Coping with Accident Reactions (CARE) early intervention programme for preventing traumatic stress reactions in young injured children: study protocol for two randomised controlled trials"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND  Accidental injury represents the most common type of traumatic event experienced by children under the age of 6 years. Around 10-30 % of young injured children will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other co-morbid conditions. Parents of injured children are also at risk of PTSD, and this is associated with short- and long-term consequences for their children's physical and psychological recovery. Despite the significance of this problem, to date, the mental health needs of injured young children have been neglected. One reason for this is due to the uncertainty and considerable debate around how to best provide early psychological intervention to traumatised children and adults. To address these gaps, researchers and psychologists in Australia and Switzerland have developed the Coping with Accident Reactions (CARE) programme, which is a two-session early intervention designed to prevent persistent PTSD reactions in young injured children screened as 'at risk'. Two separate international studies are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of this programme.  METHODS/DESIGN  The study design for the two proposed studies will employ a randomised controlled trial design and children (aged 1-6 years) who are screened as at risk for PTSD 1 week after an unintentional injury, and their parents will be randomised to either (1) CARE intervention or (2) treatment as usual. Assessment will be completed at baseline (2 weeks) and 3 and 6 months post-injury.  DISCUSSION  This international collaboration provides an excellent opportunity to test the benefit of screening and providing early intervention to young children in two different countries and settings. It is expected that outcomes from this research will lead to significant original contributions to the scientific evidence base and clinical treatment and recovery of very young injured children.  TRIAL REGISTRATION  The Australian study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12614000325606 ) on 26 March 2014. The Swiss study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02088814 ) on 12 March 2014."

    "description": [
      "After the First and Second World War period, during which the constitutional democratic procedure was largely suspended, the Swiss population mobilised and launched direct democratic procedures to put an end to this state of exception. In September 1949, the people and the federal state accepted the popular initiative \u201cBack to direct democracy\u201d (Retour \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratie directe), a vote that marked the end of the most recent experience of the state of exception in Switzerland. Does this case allow us to refute Agamben\u2019s hypothesis of the infinite extension of the state of exception, according to which \u201ctoday it is not the city but rather the camp that is the fundamental biopolitical paradigm of the West\u201d (Agamben 1998, 102), and to claim that there is a democratic way to stop the production of the permanent state of exception ? In the present article, we show that, if the initiative right granted by the Swiss democratic model can prevent the construction of the \u201ccamp as the \u2018nomos\u2019 of the modern\u201d (Agamben 1998, 95), it also introduces the possibility for the sovereign people to infringe basic democratic principles, thus opening the way to forms of \u2018democratic exception\u2019."

      "Laws of Heaven \u2013 Laws of Nature : Legal Interpretations of Cosmic Phenomena in the Ancient World"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In Western academic contexts, the idea of \u201claws of nature\u201d is often regarded as having originated among the pre-Socratics, Plato, and the Stoics. But this view is historically incorrect. Legal interpretations of cosmic phenomena go back to the ancient Near East, where such understandings also emerged in the Hebrew Bible. The present volume analyzes texts relevant to this topic, developing a fresh approach to portrayals of \u201claws of nature\u201d from antiquity. K. Schmid draws attention to some blind spots of Western history of science and to biblical texts mentioning \u201claws of heaven\u201d (\u1e25uqq\u00f4t \u0161\u0101may\u00eem, Job 38:33), \u201claws of heaven and earth\u201d (\u1e25uqq\u00f4t \u0161\u0101may\u00eem w\u0101\u2019\u0101re\u1e63, Jer 33:25) or \u201cordinances\u201d (\u1e25uqq\u00f4t) imposed on the moon and the stars (Jer 31:25). Such concepts can be compared to the Mesopotamian concept of a supreme god establishing like a legislator the rules of cosmic order. That background is elucidated in detail by F. Rochberg, whose contribution considers the Mesopotamian trope of the divine judiciary and its extension to the physical world, and discusses the question whether the case-law formulation of Akkadian omen statements (protasis-apodosis, \u201cif P, then Q\u201d) should be understood as evidence for a law-like understanding of cosmic order. W. Horowitz starts from Gen 9:12\u201317 to study the Akkadian terminology and ominous interpretations of the rainbow, which can be either benefic or malefic. F. Naether in a broad survey demonstrates that in Egypt, too, divination operated with law-like notions; she reviews texts which discuss natural phenomena without necessarily relating them to divine agency, and identifies early attempts to a \u201cphilosophy of nature.\u201d D. P. Wright, who offers a detailed study of law and creation in the Priestly-Holiness writings of the Pentateuch, highlights the differentiation established between universal conditions in creation, on the one hand, and knowledge (on sacrifice, the calendar, purity and holiness, the name of Yahweh and his k\u0101b\u00f4d) made specifically available to Israel as Yahweh\u2019s chosen people, on the other. J. L. Cooley analyzes Isa 2:1\u20134 against the background of ancient Mesopotamian divination, concluding that the biblical oracle provides a counter-narrative to Mesopotamian traditions regarding the effectiveness and antiquity of its divination tradition. M. Albani argues that in 1 Henoch the focus on astronomy and astral regularity forms the basis of an ideal calendar of 364 days, whose constance should serve as an antidote to anomia experienced in Hellenistic-period \u201cEnochic Judaism.\u201d J. H\u00fcfner, professor emeritus of theoretical physics, reviews some elementary astronomical principles discovered in antiquity, such as periodicity, increasing use of mathematics, and of models to apprehend the planetary system. C. Uehlinger summarizes common views and divergencies between the various materials surveyed, stressing the problematic status of the concept of \u201cnature\u201d with regard to ancient Near Eastern materials and pointing out the longevity, all but obvious after all, of the legal metaphor which still operates in contemporary discourse on the \u201claws of nature\u201d."

      "Both morph- and species-dependent asymmetries affect reproductive barriers between heterostylous species"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The interaction between floral traits and reproductive isolation is crucial to explaining the extraordinary diversity of angiosperms. Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that optimizes outcrossing, evolved repeatedly and has been shown to accelerate diversification in primroses, yet its potential influence on isolating mechanisms remains unexplored. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pre- versus postmating barriers to reproductive isolation is still debated. No experimental study has yet evaluated the possible effects of heterostyly on pre- and postmating reproductive mechanisms. We quantify multiple reproductive barriers between the heterostylous Primula elatior (oxlip) and P. vulgaris (primrose), which readily hybridize when co-occurring, and test whether traits of heterostyly contribute to reproductive barriers in unique ways. We find that premating isolation is key for both species, while postmating isolation is considerable only for P. vulgaris; ecogeographic isolation is crucial for both species, while phenological, seed developmental, and hybrid sterility barriers are also important in P. vulgaris, implicating sympatrically higher gene flow into P. elatior. We document for the first time that, in addition to the aforementioned species-dependent asymmetries, morph-dependent asymmetries affect reproductive barriers between heterostylous species. Indeed, the interspecific decrease of reciprocity between high sexual organs of complementary floral morphs limits interspecific pollen transfer from anthers of short-styled flowers to stigmas of long-styled flowers, while higher reciprocity between low sexual organs favors introgression over isolation from anthers of long-styled flowers to stigmas of short-styled flowers. Finally, intramorph incompatibility persists across species boundaries, but is weakened in long-styled flowers of P. elatior, opening a possible backdoor to gene flow through intramorph pollen transfer between species. Therefore, patterns of gene flow across species boundaries are likely affected by floral morph composition of adjacent populations. To summarize, our study highlights the general importance of premating isolation and newly illustrates that both morph- and species-dependent asymmetries shape boundaries between heterostylous species."

      "Posttraumatic stress disorder, adverse childhood events, and buccal cell telomere length in elderly swiss former indentured child laborers"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk for age-related diseases and early mortality. Accelerated biological aging could contribute to this elevated risk. The aim of the present study was to assess buccal cell telomere length\u2009(BTL)\u2009- a proposed marker of biological age - in men and women with and without PTSD. The role of childhood trauma was assessed as a potential additional risk factor for shorter telomere length. The sample included 62 former indentured Swiss child laborers (age: M\u2009=\u200976.19, SD\u2009=\u20096.18) and 58 healthy controls (age: M\u2009=\u200971.85, SD\u2009=\u20095.97). Structured clinical interviews were conducted to screen for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess childhood trauma exposure. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure BTL. Covariates include age, sex, years of education, self-evaluated financial situation, depression, and mental and physical functioning. Forty-eight (77.42%) of the former indentured child laborers screened positive for childhood trauma, and 21 (33.87%) had partial or full-blown PTSD. Results did not support our hypotheses that PTSD and childhood trauma would be associated with shorter BTL. In fact, results revealed a trend toward longer BTL in participants with partial or full PTSD [F(2,109)\u2009=\u20093.27, p\u2009=\u20090.04, \u03b7(2)\u2009=\u20090.06], and longer BTL was marginally associated with higher CTQ scores (age adjusted: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17 [95% CI: -0.01 to 0.35], t\u2009=\u20091.90, p\u2009=\u20090.06). Furthermore, within-group analyses indicated no significant association between BTL and CTQ scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the association between childhood trauma and BTL in older individuals with and without PTSD. Contrary to predictions, there were no significant differences in BTL between participants with and without PTSD in our adjusted analyses, and childhood adversity was not associated with BTL. Possible explanations and future research possibilities are discussed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The article reports four experiments with complex-span tasks in which encoding of memory items alternates with processing of distractors. The experiments test two assumptions of a computational model of complex span, SOB-CS: (1) distractor processing impairs memory because distractors are encoded into working memory, thereby interfering with memoranda; and (2) free time following distractors is used to remove them from working memory by unbinding their representations from list context. Experiment 1 shows that distractors are erroneously chosen for recall more often than not-presented stimuli, demonstrating that distractors are encoded into memory. Distractor intrusions declined with longer free time, as predicted by distractor removal. Experiment 2 shows these effects even when distractors precede the memory list, ruling out an account based on selective rehearsal of memoranda during free time. Experiments 3 and 4 test the notion that distractors decay over time. Both experiments show that, contrary to the notion of distractor decay, the chance of a distractor intruding at test does not decline with increasing time since encoding of that distractor. Experiment 4 provides additional evidence against the prediction from distractor decay that distractor intrusions decline over an unfilled retention interval. Taken together, the results support SOB-CS and rule out alternative explanations. Data and simulation code are available on Open Science Framework: osf.io/3ewh7."

      "Abstract: This article focuses on a number of medieval treatments of the literary figure of Cato in Lucan\u2019s Pharsalia (or Bellum civile, c. 60-c. 65 AD), who was based on the Roman politician and military general Cato of Utica, Marcus Porcius Cato Uticencis. The study begins with a detailed presentation of Cato as he is described in books II and IX of the Pharsalia, where he is the ideal incarnation of stoic virtue: just, wise, moderate, and brave. Thereafter, attention is directed towards two examples of the medieval representation of these Catonic virtues. First, the Latin glosses to the Pharsalia by Arnoul of Orleans (twelfth century) portray Cato as an example of virtue par excellence, if one considers the epic as a unconscious vehicle of the Christian message. Then, the Fet des Romains (1213-14), one of the first vernacular histories of Rome, transforms the characteristics of the Catonic, Roman and stoic virtus into that of the preudome, for pedagogical reasons. Thus, the medieval imagination, receptive to the figure of the virtuous Cato, succeeds in elaborating concepts which are markedly different from the classical model, and which align themselves closely to the new religion and to the ideals of chivalry.\r\nAbstract: Cet article s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 quelques traitements m\u00e9di\u00e9vaux de la figure du Caton lucan\u00e9en, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire du personnage litt\u00e9raire d\u00e9crit par le po\u00e8te latin Lucain dans sa Pharsalia (ou Bellum Civile, v. 60-65 ap. J.-C.), inspir\u00e9 du sto\u00efcien Caton d\u2019Utique (95-46 av. J.-C.), c\u00e9l\u00e8bre homme politique et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral romain. Apr\u00e8s une pr\u00e9sentation d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du portrait de Caton r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans les livres II et IX de la Pharsalia, qui proposent un image id\u00e9ale de la vertu sto\u00efcienne, juste, sage, sobre et courageuse, l\u2019\u00e9tude s\u2019int\u00e9resse principalement \u00e0 deux exemples de repr\u00e9sentations m\u00e9di\u00e9vales de la vertu catonienne fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9pop\u00e9e de Lucain. Tout d\u2019abord, les gloses latines d\u2019Arnoul d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans \u00e0 la Pharsalia (XIIe si\u00e8cle) font du Romain un exemple de vertu par excellence, en consid\u00e9rant l\u2019\u00e9pop\u00e9e comme porteuse inconsciente de messages chr\u00e9tiens. Puis, les Fet des Romains (1213-1214), une des premi\u00e8res Histoires de Rome en langue vernaculaire, transforment les caract\u00e9ristiques de la virtus catonienne, romaine et sto\u00efcienne, en vertus du preudome, dans un but p\u00e9dagogique. Ainsi, le terreau m\u00e9di\u00e9val, dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accueillir les \u00e9loges des vertus de Caton, produit cependant des conceptions diff\u00e9rant sensiblement du mod\u00e8le antique, en lien avec la nouvelle religion et la culture chevaleresque."

      "Airborne based spectroscopy of red and far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence: Implications for improved estimates of gross primary productivity"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Remote sensing (RS) approaches commonly applied to constrain estimates of gross primary production (GPP) employ greenness-based vegetation indices derived from surface reflectance data. Such approaches cannot capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity compared to traditional RS approaches.We use the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red fluorescence (F687), far-red fluorescence (F760), F760 yield (F760yield) and the ration between F687 and F760 (Fratio).Wecalculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation greenness.Weapply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F760 and compare this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In addition, we assess the sensitivity of F760yield and Fratio for environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability of GPP when using F760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices. F760yield and Fratio showa strong variability in time and between different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage, indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F760 improves constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in response to environmental stress conditions."

      "The Internet and generalized functions of the public sphere: Transformative potentials from a comparative perspective"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Almost since the advent of the Internet, there has been great interest in analyzing and understanding online communication from the perspective of public sphere theory. The question of whether the properties of the Internet and, specifically, social media actually contribute to the public sphere is the matter of ongoing and somewhat heated scientific debate. The aim of the article is twofold. First, we propose a hierarchical model of generalized functions of public sphere. On a theoretical level, we interweave different strands of thought on the public sphere, and the resulting model is more inclusive and less rigid than each of those strands on their own. We identify four generalized functions: identity building, agenda-setting, control and criticism, and deliberation. The Internet does not contribute equally to these functions and we evaluate the impact of the Internet on each of these functions as a diminishing marginal utility. Second, we empirically explore the plausibility of our model in a global comparative analysis with focus on the Internet. With the help of macro-level variables which indicate the structural preconditions for a public sphere, we identify the highest possible function of the public sphere for each country to which the Internet can potentially contribute. Based on this approach, future research can be contextualized: case-study-based research can plausibly articulate expectations regarding the impact of the Internet on the public sphere."

    "description": [
      "More than a decade of research has found strong evidence for P(if A, then C)=P(C|A) (\"the Equation\"). We argue, however, that this hypothesis provides an overly simplified picture due to its inability to account for relevance. We manipulated relevance in the evaluation of the probability and acceptability of indicative conditionals and found that relevance moderates the effect of P(C|A). This corroborates the Default and Penalty Hypothesis put forward in this paper. Finally, the probability and acceptability of concessive conditionals (\"Even if A, then still C\") were investigated and it was found that the Equation provides a better account of concessive conditionals than of indicatives across relevance manipulations."

      "A New Angle on the Knobe Effect: Intentionality Correlates with Blame, not with Praise"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In a celebrated experiment, Joshua Knobe showed that people are much more prone to attribute intentionality to an agent for a side effect of a given act when that side effect is harmful than when it is beneficial. This asymmetry has become known as \u2018the Knobe Effect\u2019. According to Knobe's Moral Valence Explanation (as we call it), bad effects trigger the attributions of intentionality, whereas good effects do not. Many others believe that the Knobe Effect is best explained in terms of the high amount of blame attributed in the harm condition, and the low amount of praise attributed in the help condition. This Blame Hypothesis (as we call it) explains the high number of intentionality attributions in the harm condition in terms of the high degree of blame people ascribe, and the low number of intentionality attributions in the help conditions in terms of the low degree of praise people attribute. We replicated Knobe's original experiment and conducted a logistic regression on the results to probe more deeply into the relationship between attributions of intentionality and responsibility. The statistical analysis revealed a hitherto unknown interaction effect: intentionality correlates with blame, but not with praise. This interaction effect is consistent with the Moral Valence Hypothesis, but inconsistent with the Blame Hypothesis, as well as with two of the three other hypotheses discussed here."

      "Gentrifications in pre-Olympic Rio de Janeiro"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The highly variable residential landscapes of Rio de Janeiro are changing rapidly in response to intersecting vectors: a cycle of global mega-events that has accelerated real estate speculation, the occupation of strategic favelas by state military police, and the implementation of state-led urban development projects. The general trend has been toward an increase in rents across the metropolitan region with an identifiable process of gentrification occurring in select neighborhoods. By examining data from Rio de Janeiro\u2019s primary online real estate search engine (zap.com.br), newspaper reports, interviews with residents and personal experience, this paper examines the processes of gentrification in four different regions of the city: (1) Flamengo, a centrally located middle-class neighborhood; (2) the Zona Portuaria, a port region undergoing state-financed, privately led \u201crevitalization\u201d; (3) the Vidigal favela in Rio\u2019s Zona Sul; (4) the suburban neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca, site of closed-condominium real estate speculation and Olympic-led infrastructure investment (Figure 1). The paper examines what kinds of gentrification are happening in Rio de Janeiro, suggesting a multiplicity of gentrifications within a mega-city in the Global South."

      "Characterising landscape variation through spatial folksonomies"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Describing current, past and future landscapes for inventory and policy making purposes requires classifications capturing variation in, for example, land use and land cover. Typical land cover classifi- cations for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial folksonomies, which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial folksonomies can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing a wide range of outdoor ac- tivities. The spatial folksonomies capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e.g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial folksonomies to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial folksonomies provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial folksonomies are a novel way of capturing vari- ation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services."

      "Bivariate return periods and their importance for flood peak and volume estimation"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Estimates of flood event magnitudes with a certain return period are required for the design of hydraulic structures. While the return period is clearly defined in a univariate context, its definition is more challenging when the problem at hand requires considering the dependence between two or more variables in a multivariate framework. Several ways of defining a multivariate return period have been proposed in the literature, which all rely on different probability concepts. Definitions use the conditional probability, the joint probability, or can be based on the Kendall\u2019s distribution or survival function. In this study, we give a comprehensive overview on the tools that are available to define a return period in a multivariate context. We especially address engineers, practitioners, and people who are new to the topic and provide them with an accessible introduction to the topic. We outline the theoretical background that is needed when one is in a multivariate setting and present the reader with different definitions for a bivariate return period. Here, we focus on flood events and the different probability concepts are explained with a pedagogical, illustrative example of a flood event characterized by the two variables peak discharge and flood volume. The choice of the return period has an important effect on the magnitude of the design variable quantiles, which is illustrated with a case study in Switzerland. However, this choice is not arbitrary and depends on the problem at hand."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Research on cultural consumption has focused either on socio-structural determinants or individual motives of cultural consumption. To better explain cultural consumption, we wish to more closely illuminate the role the supply side plays. We derive the role of the supply structure from a rather simple decision theoretical model of cultural demand. In our empirical investigation, we examine the impact of regional supply on the level of cultural consumption of both high and popular culture in Switzerland. We deploy two analytic strategies. First, applying multilevel analysis, we examine what influence the availability of cultural attractions in individual cantons has on cultural participation. Additionally, a quasi-experiment was used to determine whether the construction of a new cultural institution led to a systematic change in cultural behavior. Our main finding is that the availability of cultural attractions does contribute to explain cultural consumption. Nevertheless, individual socio-structural determinants remain, overall, of greater importance."

    ],
    "description": [
      "A flower from the early Cenomanian of northeastern Maryland, Cecilanthus polymerus gen. et sp. nov., is described using SEM and synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The flower has >20 strap-shaped tepals, ca. 50 spatulate stamens with embedded adaxial pollen sacs and possibly H-valvate dehiscence, and ca. 100 more-or-less plicate carpels. Floral phyllotaxis is whorled, with >10 parts per whorl, but slightly irregular. Pollen and ovules are not preserved, but locule shape suggests that the carpels are uniovulate. Similar characters occur in extant Magnoliales and the basal ANITA grade, but never in combination. In an attempt to resolve these ambiguities, we performed morphological phylogenetic analyses, with the arrangement of extant taxa constrained to trees based primarily on molecular data. With anther dehiscence and ovule number treated as unknown, Cecilanthus has several most-parsimonious positions: nested in Nymphaeales, nested in Magnoliales, sister to Laurales, and sister to Chloranthaceae. However, scoring anther dehiscence as H-valvate and ovule number as = 1, increases support for a position in Magnoliales. Cecilanthus demonstrates that the early radiation of angiosperms produced floral morphotypes unlike those in any surviving taxa, and it illustrates the value of characters such as pollen morphology and seed anatomy for phylogenetic placement of floral mesofossils."

      "It was one of the biggest events in 2014, not just for Russia but for the world. The 2014 Winter Olympic Games, held between 7 and 23 February 2014 in Sochi on the Black Sea Coast, broke a series of records. They had the highest number of participating nations (88), the highest number of athletes (2,873) and the highest number of events (98) of any Winter Games. At USD 1.26 billion, they also produced the highest revenue from broadcasting rights ever. The Sochi Games were also among the top 10 of Wikipedia articles that were most frequently edited and viewed in 2014, further attesting to the public interest in the event. But the one record that Sochi will be remembered for is a more dubious one: the most expensive Olympic games ever \u2013 summer or winter."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND\r\nInsight into user adherence to Web-based intervention programs and into its relationship to intervention effect is needed.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\nThe objective of this study was to examine use of a Web-based self-help intervention program, the Chinese version of My Trauma Recovery (CMTR), among Chinese traumatized individuals, and to investigate the relationship between program use and user characteristics before the intervention and change in outcomes after the intervention and at 3-months' follow-up.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nThe sample consisted of 56 urban survivors of different trauma types and 90 rural survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, who used the CMTR in 1 month on their own or guided by volunteers in a counseling center. Predictors were demographics (sex, age, highest education, marital status, and annual family income), health problems (trauma duration, posttraumatic symptoms, and depression), psychological factors (coping self-efficacy), and social factors (social functioning impairment and social support). Program use was assessed by general program usage (eg, number of visiting days) and program adherence (eg, webpages completed in modules). Outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Symptom Checklist 90-Depression (SCL-D), Trauma Coping Self-Efficacy scale (CSE), Crisis Support Scale (CSS), and Social Functioning Impairment questionnaire (SFI) adopted from the CMTR.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n(1) Program use: rural participants had a larger total number of visiting days (F1,144=40.50, P<.001) and visited more program modules in 1 month (\u03c7(2)3=73.67, P<.001) than urban participants. (2) Predictors and program use: total number of visiting days was correlated with CSS at pretest (r=.22, P=.009), and total number of completed webpages was associated with SFI at pretest (r=.19, P=.02). Number of webpages completed in modules was correlated with all demographic, disease severity, psychological, and social factors at pretest. (3) Program use and outcomes change: in general, use of the triggers and self-talk modules showed a consistent positive association with improvement in PDS, SCL-D, SFI, and CSE. The relaxation module was associated with positive change in PDS, but with negative change in CSS and SFI. The professional help module was associated with positive change in SCL-D, but its use on the first day was associated with negative change in CSS and CSE. The unhelpful coping module was associated with negative change in SFI. The mastery tools module showed a consistent association with negative change in PDS and SCL-D.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThese findings suggest that both individual (eg, demographic, health problems, psychological) and social factors (eg, social functioning, social support) should be considered when delivering Web-based interventions, particularly in collectivist cultures. Specific program adherence indicators (eg, webpages completed in each module, activity types completed), rather than general program usage indicators (eg, total number or time of visiting), should be developed to examine the effectiveness of various program modules or elements.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL TRIAL\r\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12611000951954; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=343399 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6G7WyNODk)."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Structural neuroimaging techniques have been used to identify cortical and subcortical regions constituting the neuroarchitecture of tinnitus. One recent investigation used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to analyze a sample of tinnitus patients (TI, n=257) [1]. A negative relationship between individual distress and cortical volume (CV) in bilateral auditory regions was observed. However, CV has meanwhile been identified as a neuroanatomical measurement that confounds genetically distinct neuroanatomical traits, namely cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA). We performed a re-analysis of the identical sample using the automated FreeSurfer surface-based morphometry (SBM) approach [2]. First, we replicated the negative correlation between tinnitus distress and bilateral supratemporal gray matter volume. Second, we observed a negative correlation for CSA in the left peri-auditory cortex and anterior insula. Furthermore, we noted a positive correlation between tinnitus duration and CT in the left peri-auditory cortex as well as a negative correlation in the subcallosal anterior cingulate, a region collated to the serotonergic circuit and germane to inhibitory functions.\r\n\r\nIn short, the results elucidate differential neuroanatomical alterations of CSA and CT for the two independent tinnitus-related psychological traits distress and duration. Beyond this, the study provides further evidence for the distinction and specific susceptibility of CSA and CT within the context of neuroplasticity of the human brain."

    ],
    "description": [
      "During senescence, chlorophyll is broken down to a set of structurally similar, but distinct linear tetrapyrrolic compounds termed phyllobilins. Structure identification of phyllobilins from over a dozen plant species revealed that modifications at different peripheral positions may cause complex phyllobilin composition in a given species. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, eight different phyllobilins have structurally been characterized to date. Accurate phyllobilin identification and quantification, which classically have been performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV/vis detection, are, however, hampered because of their similar physiochemical properties and vastly differing abundances in plant extracts. Here we established a rapid method for phyllobilin identification and quantification that couples ultra-HPLC with high-resolution/high-precision tandem mass spectrometry. Using Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant lines that are deficient in specific phyllobilin-modifying reactions, we identified a total of 16 phyllobilins, among them two that have not been described before in Arabidopsis. The single and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry data of all 16 Arabidopsis phyllobilins were collected in a mass spectrometry library, which is available to the scientific community. The library allows rapid detection and quantification of phyllobilins within and across Arabidopsis genotypes and we demonstrate its potential use for high-throughput approaches and genome-wide association studies in chlorophyll breakdown. By extending the library with phyllobilin data from other plant species in the future, we aim providing a tool for chlorophyll metabolite analysis as a measure of senescence for practical applications, such as post-harvest quality control."

      "Discriminative multiple kernel learning for hyperspectral image classification"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In this paper, we propose a discriminative multiple kernel learning (DMKL) method for spectral image classification. The core idea of the proposed method is to learn an optimal combined kernel from predefined basic kernels by maximizing separability in reproduction kernel Hilbert space. DMKL achieves the maximum separability via finding an optimal projective direction according to statistical significance, which leads to the minimum within-class scatter and maximum between-class scatter instead of a time-consuming search for the optimal kernel combination. Fisher criterion (FC) and maximum margin criterion (MMC) are used to find the optimal projective direction, thus leading to two variants of the proposed method, DMKL-FC and DMKL-MMC, respectively. After learning the projective direction, all basic kernels are projected to generate a discriminative combined kernel. Three merits are realized by DMKL. First, DMKL can achieve a substantial improvement in classification performance without strict limitation for selection of basic kernels. Second, the discriminating scales of a Gaussian kernel, the useful bands for classification, and the competitive sizes of spatial filters can be selected by ranking the corresponding weights, where the large weights correspond to the most relevant. Third, DMKL reduces the computational burden by requiring fewer support vectors. Experiments are conducted on two hyperspectral data sets and one multispectral data set. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve the best performance with satisfactory computational efficiency for spectral image classification, compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms."

      "Domain adaptation for the classification of remote sensing data: an overview of recent advances"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The success of the supervised classification of remotely sensed images acquired over large geographical areas or at short time intervals strongly depends on the representativity of the samples used to train the classification algorithm and to define the model. When training samples are collected from an image or a spatial region that is different from the one used for mapping, spectral shifts between the two distributions are likely to make the model fail. Such shifts are generally due to differences in acquisition and atmospheric conditions or to changes in the nature of the object observed. To design classification methods that are robust to data set shifts, recent remote sensing literature has considered solutions based on domain adaptation (DA) approaches. Inspired by machine-learning literature, several DA methods have been proposed to solve specific problems in remote sensing data classification. This article provides a critical review of the recent advances in DA approaches for remote sensing and presents an overview of DA methods divided into four categories: 1) invariant feature selection, 2) representation matching, 3) adaptation of classifiers, and 4) selective sampling. We provide an overview of recent methodologies, examples of applications of the considered techniques to real remote sensing images characterized by very high spatial and spectral resolution as well as possible guidelines for the selection of the method to use in real application scenarios."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) is a novel remote sensing parameter providing an estimate of actual photosynthetic rates. A combination of this new observable and Monteith\u2019s light use efficiency (LUE) concept was suggested for an advanced modeling of gross primary productivity (GPP). In this demonstration study, we evaluate the potential of both F and the more commonly used photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to approximate the LUE term in Monteith\u2019s equation and eventually improve the forward modeling of GPP diurnals. Both F and the PRI were derived from ground and airborne based spectrometer measurements over two different crops. We demonstrate that approximating dynamic changes of LUE using F and PRI significantly improves the forward modeling of GPP diurnals. Especially in sugar beet, a changing photosynthetic efficiency during the day was traceable with F and incorporating F in the forward modeling significantly improved the estimation of GPP. Airborne data were projected to produce F and PRI maps for winter wheat and sugar beet fields over the course of one day. We detected a significant variability of both, F and the PRI within one field and particularly between fields. The variability of F and PRI was higher in sugar beet, which also showed a physiological down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis. Our results underline the potential of F to serve as a superior indicator for the actual efficiency of the photosynthetic machinery, which is linked to physiological responses of vegetation."

      "Framing the concept of satellite remote sensing essential biodiversity variables: challenges and future directions"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Although satellite-based variables have for long been expected to be key components to a unified and global biodiversity monitoring strategy, a definitive and agreed list of these variables still remains elusive. The growth of interest in biodiversity variables observable from space has been partly underpinned by the development of the essential biodiversity variable (EBV) framework by the Group on Earth Observations \u2013 Biodiversity Observation Network, which itself was guided by the process of identifying essential climate variables. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by updating the previously published definition of EBV, providing a definition of satellite remote sensing (SRS) EBVs and introducing a set of principles that are believed to be necessary if ecologists and space agencies are to agree on a list of EBVs that can be routinely monitored from space. Progress toward the identification of SRS-EBVs will require a clear understanding of what makes a biodiversity variable essential, as well as agreement on who the users of the SRS-EBVs are. Technological and algorithmic developments are rapidly expanding the set of opportunities for SRS in monitoring biodiversity, and so the list of SRS-EBVs is likely to evolve over time. This means that a clear and common platform for data providers, ecologists, environmental managers, policy makers and remote sensing experts to interact and share ideas needs to be identified to support long-term coordinated actions."

      "Compressed imaging by sparse random convolution"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The theory of compressed sensing (CS) shows that signals can be acquired at sub-Nyquist rates if they are sufficiently sparse or compressible. Since many images bear this property, several acquisition models have been proposed for optical CS. An interesting approach is random convolution (RC). In contrast with single-pixel CS approaches, RC allows for the parallel capture of visual information on a sensor array as in conventional imaging approaches. Unfortunately, the RC strategy is difficult to implement as is in practical settings due to important contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) limitations. In this paper, we introduce a modified RC model circumventing such difficulties by considering measurement matrices involving sparse non-negative entries. We then implement this model based on a slightly modified microscopy setup using incoherent light. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of this approach for dealing with distinct CS scenarii, including 1-bit CS."

    ],
    "description": [
      "As online information is increasingly tailored, or \u201cpersonalised\u201d, to the user, it has been praised by some as a pragmatic response to information overload, while criticised by others as creating an echo chamber that threatens deliberative democracy. The unsettling question is whether the latest wave of innovation in online content personalisation technologies has shifted decision-making power from humans to computers. The paper argues that a thorough understanding of personalisation technologies is necessary to critically evaluate their normative effect and impact on social values. It reflects on the differences between regulation by code and regulation by law, exploring how code affects individual and social autonomies, and considering whether meta-rules regulating code are appropriate. The aim of this paper is to detail the constitutive features of the digital world and elucidate how these create norms that regulate the Internet."

      "Abundance and diversity of flower visitors on wild and cultivated cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) in Bolivia"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Despite the economic importance of Theobroma cacao, surprisingly little is known about its pollination ecology. Ceratopogonid midges are considered to be the main pollinators, but the limited available evidence on the sexual reproduction is based almost exclusively on cultivated cacao and knowledge is nonexistent for wild populations. We documented flower visitors in wild and cultivated plants by applying glue on 2237 flowers of wild and cultivated cacao trees in Bolivia to trap floral visitors. We caught 631 insects belonging to seven orders, corresponding to a mean capture rate of 0.3 insects per flower. The most abundant and diverse insect order on both cacao types was Hymenoptera, represented mainly by small parasitoids. Hymenoptera were more abundant on wild cacao, whereas species richness was higher on cultivated cacao. The abundance and species richness of Diptera were not significantly different between wild and cultivated cacao. However, species composition and proportion of Diptera species differed between both wild and cultivated cacao. Ceratopogonidae were only represented by 13 individuals belonging to seven species. Cacao pollen was carried by only a single specimen of Encyrtidae. We were thus unable to identify actual pollinators. We found significant differences among the visitor assemblages between wild and cultivated cacao, which suggest that midges alone were probably too rare to act as main or even sole pollinators of cacao in our study region. Potential additional pollinators would be small Diptera (e.g., Chloropidae and Phoridae) and Hymenoptera (e.g., Eulophidae and Platygastridae)."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Team cognition plays an important role in predicting team processes and outcomes. Thus far, research has focused on structured cognition while paying little attention to perceptual cognition. The lack of research on perceptual team cognition can be attributed to the absence of an appropriate measure. To address this gap, we introduce the construct of perceived mutual understanding (PMU) as a type of perceptual team cognition and describe the development of a respective measure \u2013 the PMU-scale. Based on three samples from different team settings (NTotal = 566), our findings show that the scale has good psychometric properties \u2013 both at the individual as well as at the teamlevel. Item parameters were improved during a multistage process. Exploratory as well as confirmatory factor analyses indicate that PMU is a one-dimensional construct. The scale demonstrates sufficient internal reliability. Correlational analyses provide initial proof of construct validity. Finally, common indicators for inter-rater reliability and inter-rater agreement suggest that treating PMU as a team-level construct is justified. The PMU-scale represents a convenient and versatile measure that will potentially foster empirical research on perceptual team cognition and thereby contribute to the advancement of team cognition research in general."

      "Avalanche risk in winter backcountry touring: status and recent trends in Switzerland"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Avalanches are the major cause of accidental death while recreating in the mountains during winter. Up to now the calculation of the statistical risk of death was difficult, mostly due to the lack of reliable data concerning touring activity. However, between 1999 and 2013 three surveys on the type and frequency of sports activities were conducted in Switzerland (\"Sport Schweiz\") with a total of 23'000 participants. In 2013, 3.9% of the Swiss residents between the age of 15 and 74 years were active winter backcountry users. This corresponds to 240'000 people, and is three times more than in 1999. The comparison of this backcountry touring activity with statistics on avalanche fatalities allows to calculate the absolute risk of death. Not considering exposure time, the risk of an active backcountry user to die in an avalanche was about 4.4 x 10 -5  per year, and thus very similar to the risk to die in a traffic accident. From 1999 to 2010, the risk per touring day decreased by nearly half. The main reason for this reduction was the increase in the proportion of snowshoe hikers, a user-group which had an about six times smaller mortality risk due to avalanches per touring day than other users of the winter backcountry. Our results help to identify high-risk user groups and allow to develop avalanche prevention measures targeted to these groups."

    ],
    "description": [
      "A simple method for real-time early warning of gravity-driven rupture that considers both the heterogeneity of natural media and characteristics of acoustic emissions attenuation is proposed. The method capitalizes on codetection of elastic waves emanating from microcracks by multiple and spatially separated sensors. Event codetection is considered as surrogate for large event size with more frequent codetected events marking imminence of catastrophic failure. Using a spatially explicit fiber bundle numerical model with spatially correlated mechanical strength and two load redistribution rules, we constructed a range of mechanical failure scenarios and associated failure events (mapped into acoustic emission) in space and time. Analysis considering hypothetical arrays of sensors and consideration of signal attenuation demonstrate the potential of the codetection principles even for insensitive sensors to provide early warning for imminent global failure."

      "What determines earmarked funding to international development organizations? Evidence from the new multi-bi aid data"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Earmarked aid to international development organizations has quadrupled over the last two decades and now represents almost twenty percent of total aid. This paper introduces a new dataset on earmarked aid, which alternatively has been referred to as multi-bi, restricted, non-core or trust fund aid. The data makes it possible to track the rise of the new aid channel over an extended period of time and in greater detail regarding, e.g., the implementing multilateral organizations. The data include more than 100,000 earmarked projects of 23 OECD donors to 290 multilateral institutions from 1990 to 2012. We graphically illustrate the distribution and patterns of this new aid channel for all actors involved, namely donor governments and their aid-providing agencies, multilateral organizations, and recipient countries, and highlight promising avenues for further research. In a first empirical application of the data, we analyze donors\u2019 heterogeneous use of earmarked aid, and test three lines of argument for the provision of earmarked aid: official donor motives regarding specific recipient needs, public opinion in donor countries, and \u2018market-oriented\u2019 donor economies\u2019 use of earmarked aid to \u2018bypass\u2019 recipient countries with weak governance. We show that earmarked aid is associated with different donor- and recipient-level factors than traditional or \u2018pure\u2019 bilateral aid."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Many argue that autocratic regimes allocate revenues from foreign aid with the aim of stabilizing their rule rather than serving economic and social development. However, donors often condition foreign aid on reforms in recipient states. We argue that when those conditions for reform focus on participative processes and government accountability, they positively affect democratization. We evaluate our claim based on different types of World Bank and IMF lending programs for a panel of 100 low- and middle-income countries over the years 1980\u20132011. Our results suggest that aid positively affects democratization when it strengthens domestic accountability mechanisms and thereby reduces its fungibility for recipients. The World Bank and the IMF\u2019s poverty reduction strategy programs provide a notable case of this effect."

    "description": [
      "This paper examines the effect of education aid on primary enrolment and education quality. Using the most recent data on aid disbursements and econometric specifications inspired by the general aid effectiveness literature, we find some evidence that donors\u2019 increase in funding has substantially contributed to the successful increase in enrolment over the last 15 years. The most robust effect is obtained by aid for education facilities and training. In addition, we find complementarities between aid for primary and secondary education. Our qualitative comparative analysis of education quality also highlights the relevance of a balanced mix of educational expenditures."

      "Is maternal trait anxiety a risk factor for late preterm and early term deliveries?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND  Anxiety is associated with preterm deliveries in general (before week 37 of pregnancy), but is that also true for late preterm (weeks 34/0-36/6) and early term deliveries (weeks 37/0-38/6)? We aim to examine this association separately for spontaneous and provider-initiated deliveries.  METHODS  Participants were pregnant women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), which has been following 95 200 pregnant women since 1999. After excluding pregnancies with serious health complications, 81\u202f244 participants remained. National ultrasound records were used to delineate late preterm, early term, and full-term deliveries, which then were subdivided into spontaneous and provider-initiated deliveries. We measured trait anxiety based on two ratings of the anxiety items on the Symptom Checklist-8 (Acta Psychiatr Scand 87:364-7, 1993). Trait anxiety was transformed into categorizing the score at the mean and at\u2009\u00b1\u20092 standard deviations.  RESULTS  Trait anxiety was substantially associated with late preterm and early term deliveries after adjusting for confounders. In the whole sample, women with the highest anxiety scores (+2 standard deviations) were more likely [(odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.7; 95 % confidence-interval (CI) 1.3-2.0)] to delivering late preterm than women with the lowest anxiety scores. Their odds of delivering early term were also high (OR\u2009=\u20091.4; CI 1.3-1.6). Women with spontaneous deliveries and the highest anxiety scores had higher odds (OR\u2009=\u20091.4; CI 1.1-1.8) of delivering late preterm and early term (OR\u2009=\u20091.3; CI\u2009=\u20091.3-1.5). The corresponding odds for women with provider-initiated deliveries were OR\u2009=\u20091.7 (CI\u2009=\u20091.2-2.4) for late preterm and OR\u2009=\u20091.3 for early term (CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.6). Irrespective of delivery onset, women with provider-initiated deliveries had higher levels of anxiety than women delivering spontaneously. However, women with high anxiety were equally likely to have provider-initiated or spontaneous deliveries.  CONCLUSIONS  This study is the first to show substantial associations between high levels of trait anxiety and late preterm delivery. Increased attention should be given to the mechanism underlying this association, including factors preceding the pregnancy. In addition, acute treatment should be offered to women displaying high levels of anxiety throughout pregnancy to avoid suffering for the mother and the child."

      "Explaining Measurement Nonequivalence Using Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling: The Case of Attitudes Toward Citizenship Rights"
    ],
    "description": [
      "It is necessary to test for equivalence of measurements across groups to guarantee that comparisons of regression coefficients or mean scores of a latent factor are meaningful. Unfortunately, when tested, many scales display non-equivalence. Several researchers have suggested that non-equivalence may be used as a useful source of information as to why equivalence is biased and proposed employing a multilevel structural equation modeling (MLSEM) approach to explain why equivalence is not given. This method can consider a latent between-level factor and/or single contextual variables and use them to explain items\u2019 non-equivalence. In the current study we show that this method may also be useful for social science studies in general and for survey research and sociological comparative studies in particular when one fails to establish cross-group equivalence. We utilize data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) national identity module (2003) to test for the cross-country equivalence of a scale measuring attitudes toward granting citizenship rights to immigrants. As expected, the scale fails to achieve scalar equivalence. However, we explain a significant part of the most non-equivalent intercept by a latent between-level factor and one contextual variable, namely, the percentage of foreigners in the country relying on group threat theory. We show that the method does not necessarily rectify non-equivalence but it can help to explain why it is absent."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In recent years, local journalism as well as social cohesion have faced disruptions and discontinuities. While local journalism is challenged by dwindling readership, media concentration, and economic crisis, social cohesion in cities is dealing with social fragmentation, gentrification, and the increasing inflow of migrants. At the same time, the concepts are interrelated, as perceptions of belonging, identity, or community are heavily mediatized: local media provide the informational backbone of what people know about social life in their city. In our study, we operationalize cohesion as a multidimensional concept and discuss the results from a standardized content analysis of about 1300 articles in seven local newspapers from three German cities. We find remarkably similar images of social cohesion across cities. However, while social cohesion is similarly reported across cities, we found wide variation across newspaper types. Depending on whether readers prefer local newspapers, weekly advertisers or tabloids, they are presented with different images of their local society."

      "The selection and retrieval of relevant information from the information universe on the web is becoming increasingly important in addressing information overload. It has also been recognized that geography is an important criterion of relevance, leading to the research area of geographic information retrieval. As users increasingly retrieve information in mobile situations, relevance is often related to geographic features in the real world as well as their representation in web documents. We present 2 methods for assessing geographic relevance (GR) of geographic entities in a mobile use context that include the 5 criteria topicality, spatiotemporal\r\nproximity, directionality, cluster, and colocation. To determine the effectiveness and validity of these methods, we evaluate them through a user study conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. An analysis of relevance ranks for geographic entities in 3 scenarios produced by two GR methods, 2\r\nbaseline methods, and human judgments collected in the experiment reveal that one of the GR methods produces similar ranks as human assessors."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Multispectral satellite images are often contaminated by haze and/or cirrus. A previous paper presented a haze removal method that calculates a haze thickness map (HTM) based on a local search of dark objects. The haze-free signal is restored by subtracting the HTM from the hazy image assuming an additive model of the haze influence. The HTM method is substantially improved by employing the 1.38-\u03bcm cirrus band. The top-of-atmosphere reflectance cirrus band is used as an additional source of information. The method restores the information in highly inhomogeneous surfaces attenuated by a low-altitude haze and high-altitude cirrus, improving the interpretation of the scene content while preserving the shape of the spectral signatures. The new enhanced HTM method is successfully applied to Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 real and simulated scenes."

      "Differentiating between rain, snow, and glacier contributions to river discharge in the western Himalaya using remote-sensing data and distributed hydrological modeling"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Rivers draining the southern Himalaya provide most of the water supply for the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains. Despite the importance of water resources in light of climate change, the relative contributions of rainfall, snow and glacier melt to discharge are not well understood, due to the scarcity of ground-based data in this complex terrain. Here, we quantify discharge sources in the Sutlej Valley, western Himalaya, from 2000 to 2012 with a distributed hydrological model that is based on daily, ground-calibrated remote-sensing observation. Based on the consistently good model performance, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of hydrologic components and quantified their contribution to river discharge. Our results indicate that the Sutlej River's annual discharge at the mountain front is sourced to 55% by effective rainfall (rainfall reduced by evapotranspiration), 35% by snow melt and 10% by glacier melt. In the high-elevation orogenic interior glacial runoff contributes \u223c30% to annual river discharge. These glacier melt contributions are especially important during years with substantially reduced rainfall and snowmelt runoff, as during 2004, to compensate for low river discharge and ensure sustained water supply and hydropower generation. In 2004, discharge of the Sutlej River totaled only half the maximum annual discharge; with 17.3% being sourced by glacier melt. Our findings underscore the importance of calibrating remote-sensing data with ground-based data to constrain hydrological models with reasonable accuracy. For instance, we found that TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) product 3B42 V7 systematically overestimates rainfall in arid regions of our study area by a factor of up to 5. By quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources we provide an important assessment of the potential impact of global warming on river discharge in the western Himalaya. Given the near-global coverage of the utilized remote-sensing datasets this hydrological modeling approach can be readily transferred to other data-sparse regions."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Capturing and quantifying theworld in three dimensions (x,y,z) using light detection and ranging (lidar) technology drives fundamental advances in the Earth and Ecological Sciences (EES). However, additional lidar dimensions offer the possibility to transcend basic 3-D mapping capabilities, including i) the physical time (t) dimension from repeat lidar acquisition and ii) laser return intensity (LRI\u03bb) data dimension based on the brightness of single- or multi-wavelength (\u03bb) laser returns. The additional dimensions thus add to the x,y, and z dimensions to constitute the five dimensions of lidar (x,y,z, t, LRI\u03bb1\u2026 \u03bbn). This broader spectrum of liar dimensionality has already revealed new insights across multiple EES topics, and will enable a wide range of new research and applications. Here, we review recent advances based on repeat lidar collections and analysis of LRI data to highlight novel applications of lidar remote sensing beyond 3-D. Our review outlines the potential and current challenges of time and LRI information from lidar sensors to expand the scope of research applications and insights across the full range of EES applications."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Adult emotion regulation is not only occurring within the person but includes strategies that happen in social interactions and that are framed as co-regulating. The current study investigates the role of the interpersonal emotion regulation strategies of co-reappraisal and co-brooding in couples for adjustment disorder symptoms as the disorder will be outlined in the International Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11).\r\nMETHODS: Couples registered together in an online questionnaire study reporting whether or not they are adjusting to a major stressor that is psychologically challenging to them. In total, one hundred and forty-six participants (N\u2009=\u200973 male; N\u2009=\u200973 female) reported having experienced a major stressor in the last 12\u00a0months and were thus be identified as at risk for adjustment disorder. Those individuals at risk were assessed for adjustment disorder and depressive symptoms; intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation (co-/brooding, co-/reappraisal) were assessed not only in the individual at risk but also in the romantic partner.\r\nRESULTS: Regression-based dyadic analyses revealed that above and beyond intrapersonal emotion regulation, interpersonal co-brooding and for the female participants also co-reappraisal were significantly associated with symptoms of adjustment disorder and depression, standardized betas varied between .24 and .36, suggesting medium effect sizes. An association with the female partner's tendency to reappraise with fewer symptoms in the male partner at risk for adjustment disorder could also be observed.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Co-brooding and co-reappraisal represent emotion regulation strategies that happen in social interaction and seem to play a relevant role in the context of adjustment disorders above and beyond the commonly assessed intrapersonal emotion regulation strategies."

Nevertheless, confusion remains over whether different names and proposed symptom criteria for this disorder identify the same or different diagnostic entities. This study aimed to determine whether PGD, complicated grief (CG), and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) as described by the DSM-5 are substantively or merely semantically different diagnostic entities. Data were derived from the Yale Bereavement Study, a longitudinal community-based study of bereaved individuals funded by the US National Institute of Mental Health, designed explicitly to evaluate diagnostic criteria for disordered grief. The results suggested that the difference between PGD and PCBD is only semantic. The level of agreement between the original PGD test, a new version of the PGD test proposed for ICD-11 and the PCBD test was high (pairwise kappa coefficients\u2009=\u20090.80-0.84). Their estimates of rate of disorder in this community sample were similarly low (\u223c10%). Their levels of diagnostic specificity were comparably high (95.0-98.3%). Their predictive validity was comparable. In contrast, the test for CG had only moderate agreement with those for PGD and PCBD; its estimate of rate of disorder was three-fold higher (\u223c30%); its diagnostic specificity was poorer, and it had no predictive validity. We conclude that PGD, PCBD and proposed ICD-11, but not CG, symptom-diagnostic tests identify a single diagnostic entity. Ultimately, brief symptom-diagnostic tests, such as the one proposed here for ICD-11, may have the greatest clinical utility."

      "Contemporary Fatherhood and Its Consequences for Paternal Psychological Well-being - A Cross-sectional Study of Fathers in Central Europe"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The emotional consequences of fatherhood are markedly conditional on the context in which fatherhood is lived out. This study examines the association between different contemporary forms of fatherhood and paternal psychological well-being. The data are from an anonymous online survey of 3615 biological fathers, stepfathers, adoptive fathers, and foster fathers across the German-speaking countries of Central Europe. First, a detailed characterization of the different existing family constellations is provided. Second, the consequences of these different contemporary forms of fatherhood for paternal psychological well-being are investigated. Fathers of all ages (M\u2009=\u200940.11, range: 19-72) with at least one child under the age of 18 were included in the present analysis (N\u2009=\u20092785). The presented findings demonstrate that a family structure consisting of two biological parents with biological children seems to be most beneficial to paternal well-being, while some other forms of contemporary fatherhood are associated with impaired well-being, independently of sociodemographic or relationship aspects. More specifically, a history of family separation in non-residential biological fathers and blended-family fathers, and the concomitant loss of father-child contact, is shown to be particularly disadvantageous for the well-being of these fathers. Shared living arrangements, maintaining regular contact with biological children, or forming a new intact family could protect these fathers from negative outcomes."

      "Congruence or Compensation? How Support for Subnational Democracy is Linked to Support for Metropolitan Integration"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Modern democracies face two major challenges to their legitimacy: i.) the spread of public disaffection with politics and ii.) the transfer of governance functions away from nation-state institutions. In this paper I aim to link these two challenges by taking on an attitudinal perspective. Analyzing metropolitan areas, subnational multi-level governance contexts, I assess how public discontent is linked to citizens\u2019 support for the political integration of metropolitan areas. Public opinion scholar investigating European integration have proposed a negative - compensation - and a positive - congruence - relation between public discontent and support for integration. Drawing on data from a recent citizen survey in eightWestern European metropolitan areas, I test these two propositions for the metropolitan context. The findings support the congruence proposition: Citizens that are dissatisfied and distrusting of subnational democracy are also less supportive of metropolitan integration. Citizens do certainly not view transferring governance functions to other levels as a remedy for some of nation-state\u2019s deficiencies - whether such reforms are the cause of their discontent or act as an enhancer is a question to be answered by future research."

      "How Citizens\u2019 Views of Democracy Impact Their Evaluation of Metropolitan Governance Arrangements: Evidence From a Comparative Conjoint Experiment"
    ],
    "description": [
      "What features are important for democracy from a citizens\u2019 perspective? How do citizens\u2019 views of what democracy should be translate into their day-to-day evaluation of real-existing institutions? These questions have gained a renewed interest in scholarly debates as the notion of democracy as a multi-layered and contested concept has become dominant. Existing research assesses what views of democracy citizens hold and how they combine into different models, but they tell us little about what citizens prefer when they cannot maximize all dimensions at the same time. We shed light on this question by analyzing citizens\u2019 evaluations of different governance arrangements that vary with respect to their input-, throughput- and output-legitimacy and their formal authority. We draw on data from an online-conjoint experiment conducted in eight metropolitan areas in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We find, first, that output-legitimacy is the most important driver for citizens\u2019 choice of a governance arrangement. Second, we find that the importance citizens attribute to different dimensions of these governance bodies is a function of their more general views of democracy. Yet, third, the output-dimension is the most important driver for citizens\u2019 choice of a governance arrangement, irrespective of their views of democracy. Our findings suggest that political actors and institutions can gain legitimacy primarily through the provision of \u201cgood output\u201d. However, democratic procedures in the form of input- and throughput-legitimacy remain important traits of democratic governance."

    "description": [
      "The Book of Revelation is a peculiar text whose special status in early Christianity is manifested by its manuscript attestation, transmission, literary references and discussions among early Church writers. This special status forms the nucleus of these collected essays and is highlighted from various perspectives. Nowadays of course, the Apocalypse has become a treasure trove of famous motifs for artists, composers, poets and novelists. On the other hand, however, it also appears to be something of a bon mot in that its manuscript tradition is rather sparse and highly distinctive. With the help of single phenomena that revolve around the extraordinary attestation and transmission of Revelation, the authors here are able to unveil how its peculiarity was perceived in early Christianity. Its manifestation in manuscripts and in the lively controversy about its value and orthodoxy thus resulted in it being treated as unique."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Explaining social policy preferences has become a major topic in comparative politics with labor market risk as a key determinant of these preferences. However, one question continues to loom large: are preference divides blurred by mixed households, that is, secure labor market participants living with vulnerable partners? In this article, we build on the insider-outsider literature and show that while the household does matter, its mitigating effect is limited in scope and strongly conditional on gender. Women\u2019s preferences depend on their partner\u2019s labor market situation, while men\u2019s preferences are unaffected by it. Overall, only a small minority of the population across Western Europe benefits from a \u201chousehold safety net.\u201d Our findings have important implications for understanding the politicization of insider-outsider divides."

    ],
    "description": [
      "How does national crisis management affect the electoral fortunes of coalition governments? Drawing on micro-level data from just before the 2009 federal elections in Germany, this article investigates how voters' evaluation of specific policies against the global financial crisis affected approval of and voting intentions for the then-governing grand coalition. We find that voters in favour of the two most prominent anti-crisis policies, the car-scrap bonus and the public guarantee for banks, were more likely to approve of and to vote for the two incumbent parties. These evaluations of specific policies influenced individuals' vote choice in addition to their assessments of the economic situation more generally and in addition to party identification. This suggests that even in the greatest economic turmoil with blurred political responsibilities, government parties can win or lose voters through the implementation of specific economic policies."

    "description": [
      "How does offshoring affect individual party preferences in multi-party systems? We argue that exposure to offshoring influences individual preferences for those political parties with clear policy positions on issues relevant for individuals with offshorable jobs (left, liberal and center-right parties), but does not affect voting decisions for parties concentrating on other issues (green parties or populist right parties). Examining individual-level data from five waves of the European Social Survey for 18 advanced democracies, we find that these effects vary by skill and exposure. Offshoring increases the preference for parties advocating economic openness among the highly skilled. In contrast, among the low-skilled, those exposed to offshoring are more likely to prefer leftist political parties that champion social protection and redistribution."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Citizens unequally participate in referendums, and this may systematically bias policy in favor of those who vote. Some view compulsory voting as an important tool to alleviate this problem, whereas others worry about its detrimental effects on the legitimacy and quality of democratic decision making. So far, however, we lack systematic knowledge about the causal effect of compulsory voting on public policy. We argue that sanctioned compulsory voting mobilizes citizens at the bottom of the income distribution and that this translates into an increase in support for leftist policies. We empirically explore the effects of a sanctioned compulsory voting law on direct-democratic decision making in Switzerland. We find that compulsory voting significantly increases electoral support for leftist policy positions in referendums by up to 20 percentage points. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the policy consequences of electoral institutions."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Recently, the increasing availability of digital cameras and the rapid advances in social media have led to the accumulation of a large number of geotagged photos, which may reflect people\u2019s travel experiences in different cities and can be used to generate location recommendations for tourists. Research on this aspect mainly focused on providing personalized recommendations matching a tourist\u2019s travel preferences, while ignoring the context of the visit (e.g., weather, season and time of the day) that potentially influences his/her travel behavior. This article explores context-aware methods to provide location recommendations matching a tourist\u2019s travel preferences and visiting context. Specifically, we apply clustering methods to detect touristic locations and extract travel histories from geotagged photos on Flickr. We then propose a novel context similarity measure to quantify the similarity between any two contexts and develop three context-aware collaborative filtering methods, i.e., contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering and modeling. With these methods, location recommendations like \u201cin similar contexts, other tourists similar to you often visited . . . \u201d can be provided to the current user. Results of the evaluation with a publicly-available Flickr photo collection show that these methods are able to provide a tourist with location recommendations matching his/her travel preferences and visiting context. More importantly, compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed methods, which employ the introduced context similarity measure, can provide tourists with significantly better recommendations. While Flickr data have been used in this study, these context-aware collaborative filtering (CaCF) methods can also be extended for other kinds of travel histories, such as GPS trajectories and Foursquare check-ins, to provide context-aware recommendations."

    "description": [
      "This book focuses on the study of the remarkable new source of geographic information that has become available in the form of user-generated content accessible over the Internet through mobile and Web applications. The exploitation, integration and application of these sources, termed volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowdsourced geographic information (CGI), offer scientists an unprecedented opportunity to conduct research on a variety of topics at multiple scales and for diversified objectives.\r\nThe Handbook is organized in five parts, addressing the fundamental questions: What motivates citizens to provide such information in the public domain, and what factors govern/predict its validity?What methods might be used to validate such information? Can VGI be framed within the larger domain of sensor networks, in which inert and static sensors are replaced or combined by intelligent and mobile humans equipped with sensing devices? What limitations are imposed on VGI by differential access to broadband Internet, mobile phones, and other communication technologies, and by concerns over privacy? How do VGI and crowdsourcing enable innovation applications to benefit human society?\r\nChapters examine how crowdsourcing techniques and methods, and the VGI phenomenon, have motivated a multidisciplinary research community to identify both fields of applications and quality criteria depending on the use of VGI. Besides harvesting tools and storage of these data, research has paid remarkable attention to these information resources, in an age when information and participation is one of the most important drivers of development.\r\nThe collection opens questions and points to new research directions in addition to the findings that each of the authors demonstrates. Despite rapid progress in VGI research, this Handbook also shows that there are technical, social, political and methodological challenges that require further studies and research."

      "Creating multi-temporal composites of airborne imaging spectroscopy data in support of digital soil mapping"
    ],
    "description": [
      "An increasing demand for full spatio-temporal coverage of soil information drives the growing use of soil spectroscopy. Soil spectroscopy application performed under laboratory conditions or in-field studies in semi-arid areas have shown promising results. However, when acquiring data in temperate zones, limitations by vegetation-free coverage, variation in soil moisture and management are driving coherent spatio-temporal data collection. This study explores the use of multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy data to increase the total mapping area of bare soils in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. Spectrally and spatially high-resolution data from the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) were collected in September 2013, April 2014 and April 2015. Bare soils in all acquisitions were identified. To eliminate short-term differences in soil moisture and soil surface roughness, the empirical line method was used to calibrate the reflectance values of the singular images (2013 and 2015) towards the singular image with most bare soil pixels (2014). Difference indicators show that the calibration was successful (decrease in root mean square difference and angle difference, increase in R2 and gain and offset close to one and zero). Finally, the multi-temporal composite image contained more than double the amount of bare soil pixels as compared to a singular acquisition. Summary statistics show that reflectance values of the multi-temporal composite approximate the single image data of 2014 (mean and standard deviation of 2014: 24.2  8.9 vs. 24.0  9.5 for the multi-temporal composite of 2013, 2014 and 2015). This indicates that global differences in soil moisture and land management have been corrected for. As a result, an improved spatial representation of soil parameters can be retrieved from the composite data. Spatial distribution of the correction factors and analysis of the spatial variability of all images, however, indicate that non-linear, short-term differences like variation in soil moisture and land management largely influence the result of the multi-temporal composite. Quantification and attribution of those factors will be required in the future to allow correcting for them."

      "Determination of target detection limits in hyperspectral data using band selection and dimensionality reduction"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Hyperspectral remote  sensing data  can be used for civil and military  applications to robustly  detect  and classify\"\r\n\"target objects.  High spectral  resolution  of hyperspectral data  can compensate  for the comparatively low spatial resolution,  which allows for detection  and  classification  of small  targets, even below image resolution.   Hyper- spectral  data  sets  are  prone  to  considerable  spectral  redundancy, affecting  and  limiting  data  processing  and algorithm performance.   As a consequence,  data  reduction strategies become increasingly  important, especially in view of near-real-time data  analysis.  The goal of this paper  is to analyze different strategies for hyperspectral band  selection  algorithms  and  their  effect on subpixel  classification  for different  target and  background mate- rials.  Airborne  hyperspectral data  is used in combination with  linear  target simulation  procedures  to create  a representative amount of target-to-background ratios  for evaluation of detection  limits.  Data  from two different airborne  hyperspectral sensors, AISA Eagle & Hawk, are used to evaluate  transferability of band  selection when using different  sensors.  The  same target objects  were recorded  to compare  the  calculated  detection  limits.   To determine subpixel classification results,  pure pixels from the target materials are extracted and used to simulate mixed  pixels with  selected  background materials.  Target signatures are linearly  combined  with  different  back- ground  materials in varying  ratios.  The commonly used classification  algorithms  Adaptive  Coherence Estimator (ACE)  is used to compare the detection  limit for the original data  with several band selection and data  reduction strategies.  The  evaluation of the  classification  results  is done by assuming  a fixed false alarm  ratio  and  calcu- lating  the  mean  target-to-background ratio  of correctly detected pixels.  The  results  allow drawing  conclusions about  specific band combinations for certain  target and background combinations. Additionally, generally useful wavelength  ranges are determined and the optimal  amount of principal  components  is analyzed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Given the importance of natural resources exploration, generalization in geological mapping is receiving increasing interest, though only few reliable automated generalization tools are available for this purpose today. Thus, improvements to methods for the generalization of categorical data, such as geological or soil maps are in demand. In this short paper, we advocate a constraint-based approach for geological map generalization, which could be implemented by integrating vector and raster based generalization methods. We start by laying out the conceptual framework of this integrated approach. We then continue by defining some sample constraints that can be used to control the generalization process. And we show some initial implementations and experiments with generalization operations in the vector and raster domain."

      "Double funnelling in a mature coastal British Columbia forest: spatial patterns of stemflow after infiltration"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Many studies have focused on the amount of stemflow in different forests and for different rainfall events, but few studies have focused on how stemflow intensity varies during events or the infiltration of stemflow into the soil. Stemflow may lead to higher water delivery rates at the base of the tree compared with throughfall over the same area and fast and deeper infiltration of this water along roots and other preferential flow pathways. In this study, stemflow amounts and intensities were measured and blue dye experiments were conducted in a mature coniferous forest in coastal British Columbia to examine double funneling of stemflow. Stemflow accounted for only 1% of precipitation and increased linearly with event total precipitation. Funneling ratios ranged from less than 1 to almost 20; smaller trees had larger funnelling ratios. Stemflow intensity generally was highest for periods with high-intensity rainfall later in the event. The maximum stemflow intensities were higher than the maximum precipitation intensities. Dye tracer experiments showed that stemflow infiltrated primarily along roots and was found more frequently at depth than near the soil surface. Lateral flow of stemflow was observed above a dense clay layer for both the throughfall and stemflow experiments. Stemflow appeared to infiltrate deeper (122 cm) than throughfall (85 cm), but this difference was in part a result of site-specific differences in maximum soil depth. However, the observed high stem flow intensities combined with preferential flow of stemflow may lead to enhanced subsurface stormflow. This suggests that even though stemflow is only a very minor component of the water balance, it may still significantly affect soil moisture, recharge, and runoff generation."

      "Brief communication: On area- and slope-related thickness estimates and volume calculations for unmeasured glaciers"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Area- and slope-related techniques have been used to estimate thicknesses and to calculate volumes of unmeasured glaciers on the basis of glacier outlines and corresponding glacier surface areas in glacier inventories. The present communication critically reflects key aspects involved with the application of these approaches to field data. Area-related empirical statistics are known to only provide order-of-magnitude estimates if applied to individual glaciers or glacier ensembles spanning less than several orders of magnitude. Even at this scale, however, problems exist with respect to calibration/validation, error propagation, artefacts (immediate mass loss in case of coalescing/disintegrating composite glaciers) and shortcomings (no detection of ice below sea level or below lake levels on land in view of glacier contributions to sea-level rise). 3-D-flux/stress/slope-related approaches and numerical models are better constrained by calibration/validation with field measurements. They help with overcoming the problems of 2-D-area-related statistics in that they allow for calculating detailed glacier bed topographies at all scales, from individual glaciers to global ensembles. Corresponding results are available today and can be further improved."

      "Heart versus mind: how affective and cognitive message frames change attitudes"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Several researchers have pursued the question of whether affective or cognitive persuasion appeals are more successful in changing attitudes. The vast majority of studies in this field have found that the persuasiveness of affective and cognitive appeals depends on the extent to which recipients\u2019 existing attitudes are based on affect or cognition: Affective messages are more successful in changing affect-based attitudes; cognitive messages are more successful in changing cognition-based attitudes. However, research to date has not uncovered the processes leading to these effects. In the present article it is argued that there are two plausible explanations. First, matching messages to informational attitude bases might heighten message scrutiny. This would mean that a central process underlies the effects. Second, a peripheral process might account for the effects. Specifically, processing fluency might act as a peripheral cue. The results of an experimental study clearly suggest that that processing fluency underlies the effects."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present study investigates how emotional and rational appeals in political news media stories interact with preexisting attitudes in changing citizens\u2019 political attitudes. It is hypothesized that news media appeals that match predispositions are more likely to affect attitudes than mismatching media appeals. That is, people holding attitudes primarily based on affect should be more susceptible to emotionally arousing media content than to rational appeals. For people holding attitudes primarily based on cognition, rational appeals in news media are expected to be more persuasive than emotional appeals. These assumptions were tested in a real-world setting in the run-up of a popular vote on immigration. In order to test the hypotheses, the data of a three-wave panel survey were matched with data from a content analysis of the news coverage on the issue. Results indicate the expected matching effects: Voters whose attitudes are primarily based on affect were more likely to change their attitude when confronted with emotional appeals as compared to rational appeals. In contrast, voters holding cognitively based attitudes were more likely to change their attitude when they received rational appeals as compared to emotional appeals."

      "A multi-dimensional measure to assess populist attitudes in the public in eight languages"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Research on populism has primarily traced the phenomenon within party manifestoes or mass media content. Research on its manifestation within people\u2019s heads has played a minor role. Yet, as populist parties are undoubtedly on the rise it seems of high importance to investigate on political attitudes that can be related to voting for these parties. The few studies that have to date endeavored to measure populist attitudes in the public have treated the concept as a unidimensional construct (e.g., Akkerman, Mudde & Zaslove, 2013). However, theoretically, populism has been defined as a political ideology set together by three different political ideas or sub-dimensions: anti-elitism attitudes, a preference for popular sovereignty, and a belief in the homogeneous and virtuous of the people. Hence, in order to trace the complete phenomenon, we propose to conceptualize populist attitudes as a latent higher-order construct with three distinct first-order dimensions.\r\nFollowing this approach we developed a 9- and a 12-item inventory (PopAtt9 and PopAtt12) to measure populist attitudes. Construct validity of the measure was demonstrated by both, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (cf. Schulz, et al. 2016). For the 9-item inventory, each sub-dimension of populist attitudes is represented by 3 indicator-items, for the 12-item inventory each sub-dimension is represented by 4 indicator-items. The authors recommend using the 12-item inventory. However, if space is restricted, the short version can be employed. This working paper documents the respective 9- and 12-item scales in eight languages. Available languages are English, Bulgarian, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Polish, Swedish."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This working paper approaches the study of populism from an explicit political communication perspective and thereby adds a new and original dimension to the existing literature. It first reviews the existing approaches to populism and then combines them within an integrative framework for populism research. This framework understands populism as ideology, strategy, or style and arranges them in a way that permits the empirical analysis of populism in political communication, media and the attitudes of the people. The framework serves as a guide for developing straightforward instruments to identify and quantitatively measure populism in the self-presentation of actors, in news media and other forms of communication, as well as in public opinion. By virtue of the broadness of the framework, it is applicable to longitudinal and cross-cultural analyses of populism, as well as the investigation of the flow of populist ideology among political actors, the media, and the public. It takes a non-normative and primarily analytical perspective. The working paper has two major aims. First, it is intended to provide a common ground for populism research within Research Module II of the NCCR Democracy at the University of Zurich. Second, it is intended to distribute our framework for investigating the relationship between populism and political communication to other scholars and thereby facilitate cumulative research."

      "During 2013 and 2014, we investigated the process of the spreading of evergreen broad-leaved (laurophyllous) species in the deciduous forests of southern Ticino (Switzerland) and neighboring northern Lago Maggiore (Italy). The mild climate of this region allows a diversity of exotic plants to thrive outdoors. Most noticeable is the Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei), cultivated in almost every private garden and park around the lakes of  southern Switzerland.  This palm species has been spreading into the nearby forests for decades. Our research deals with several aspects of  the spread of  Trachycarpus fortunei in the investigated region, such as the occurrence within the vertical layer of the forest structure since earlier surveys. The ecological conditions in which this palm species thrives best in the research area are analyzed. In addition, we discuss possible causes that may have contributed to the spread of Trachycarpus fortunei, such as the environmental dynamics of the past 40  years as global warming and anthropogenic impacts."

      "This study presents the first reanalysis of a long-term glacier mass-balance record in the Canadian Arctic. The reanalysis is accomplished through comparison of the 1960\u20132014 glaciological mass-balance record of White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut, with a geodetically derived mass change over the same period. The corrections applied to homogenize the two datasets, including adjusting for changes in hypsometry over the period of record and the generic differences between methods, are discussed along with the associated systematic and random errors of the two forms of mass-balance measurement. Statistical comparison of the two datasets reveals that within the error margin there is no significant difference between the average annual glaciological balance (\u2013213 \u00b1 28 mm w.e. a\u22121) and geodetic balance (\u2013178 \u00b1 16 mm w.e. a\u22121) at White Glacier over the 54 year record. The validity of this result, and the assumptions made in implementing the glaciological method, are critically assessed."

      "A complete glacier inventory of the Antarctic Peninsula based on Landsat7 images from 2000-2002 and other pre-existing datasets"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) potentially make a large contribution to sea level rise. However, this contribution has been difficult to estimate, as no complete glacier inventory (outlines, attributes, separation from the ice sheet) has been available. This work fills the gap and presents a new glacier inventory of the AP north of 70\u00b0\u2009S, based on digitally combining pre-existing datasets with GIS techniques. Rock outcrops have been removed from the glacier basin outlines of Cook et al. (2014) by digital intersection with the latest layer of the Antarctic Digital Database (Burton-Johnson et al., 2016). Glacier-specific topographic parameters (e.g. mean elevation, slope and aspect) as well as hypsometry have been calculated from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Cook et al. (2012). We also assigned connectivity levels to all glaciers following the concept by Rastner et al. (2012). Moreover, the bedrock dataset of Huss and Farinotti (2014) enabled us to add ice thickness and volume for each glacier. \r\nThe new inventory is available from the GLIMS database (doi:10.7265/N5V98602) and consists of 1589 glaciers covering an area of 95\u2009273\u2009km2, slightly more than the 90\u2009000\u2009km2 covered by glaciers surrounding the Greenland Ice Sheet. The total ice volume is 34\u2009590\u2009km3, of which 1/3 is below sea level. The hypsometric curve has a bimodal shape due to the unique topography of the AP, which consists mainly of ice caps with outlet glaciers. Most of the glacierized area is located at 200\u2013500\u2009m\u2009a.s.l. with a secondary maximum at 1500\u20131900\u2009m. Approximately 63\u2009% of the area is drained by marine-terminating glaciers, and ice shelf tributary glaciers cover 35\u2009% of the area. This combination indicates a high sensitivity of the glaciers to climate change for several reasons: (1) only slightly rising equilibrium line altitudes would expose huge additional areas to ablation, (2) rising ocean temperatures increase melting of marine terminating glaciers, and (3) ice shelves have a buttressing effect on their feeding glaciers and their collapse would alter glacier dynamics and strongly enhance ice loss (Rott et al., 2011). The new inventory should facilitate modelling of the related effects using approaches tailored to glaciers for a more accurate determination of their future evolution and contribution to sea level rise."

      "Estimation of snowfall limit for the Kashmir Valley, Indian Himalayas, with TRMM\u00a0PR Bright Band information"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Knowing the height of the snowfall limit during precipitation events is crucial for better understanding a number of hydro-climatic processes, for instance glacier-climate interactions or runoff from high mountain catchments. However, knowledge on heights of the phase change during precipitation events is limited by the small number of meteorological measurements available at high altitudes, such as the Himalayas. The bright band (BB) of satellite based radar data may be a promising proxy for the snow/rain transition during particular stratiform precipitation events over high mountain regions. The BB is a horizontal layer of stronger radar reflectivity caused by the melting of hydrometeors at the level where solid precipitation turns into rain. Here, we present BB heights detected by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) 2A23 algorithm over a mountainous area. To assess the performance of BB heights, we have compared a 17-year data set of BB estimations of the TRMM PR with radiosonde observations and meteorological station data from Srinagar, Kashmir Valley, India. During March to November, the BB lies mostly about 200 to 800m below the freezing level (FL) recorded by radiosondes. The correlation between BB and FL heights extrapolated from a ground-based station is smaller and depends on the timing of the air temperature measurement \u2013 an important finding for applying extrapolation techniques in data sparse regions. Further on, we found a strong seasonal and monthly variability of the BB height, e.g. extending in summer months from about 2700m to almost 6000m asl. Comparison with near surface rain intensity from the TRMM PR product 2A25 indicates that \u2013 during intense monsoonal summer precipitation events \u2013 the BB height is concentrated between about 3500 and 4000m asl. We can conclude that TRMM PR BB data deliver valuable complementary information for regional or seasonal variability in snow/rain transition in data sparse regions and, further on, BB data from surrounding lowlands could be used to validate extrapolation approaches to assess snowfall limit for mainly stratiform precipitation events where stations at high elevations are missing."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Pronounced hygric seasonality determines the regional climate and, thus, the characteristics of rained agriculture in the Peruvian Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas (Cordillera Blanca). Peasants in the Cuenca Auqui on the eastern slopes above the city of Huaraz attribute recently experienced challenges in agricultural production mainly to perceived changes in precipitation patterns. Statistical analyses of daily precipitation records at nearby Recuay (1964 to 2013) and Huaraz (1996 to 2013) stations do not corroborate the perceived changes. Either insufficient temporal resolution of available precipitation records or other environmental and sociopolitical factors impacting traditional farming methods may be the reason for the lack of concordance between the two information sources investigated in this study."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Comparative Philosophy without Borders presents original scholarship by leading contemporary comparative philosophers, each addressing a philosophical issue that transcends the concerns of any one cultural tradition. By critically discussing and weaving together these contributions in terms of their philosophical presuppositions, this cutting-edge volume initiates a more sophisticated, albeit diverse, understanding of doing comparative philosophy. Within a broad conception of the alternative shapes that work in philosophy may take, this volume breaks three kinds of boundaries: between cultures, historical periods and sub-disciplines of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy.\r\nAs well as distinguishing three phases of the development of comparative philosophy up to the present day, the editors argue why the discipline now needs to enter a new phase. Putting to use philosophical thought and textual sources from Eurasia and Africa, contributors discuss modern psychological and cognitive science approaches to the nature of mind and topics as different as perception, poetry, justice, authority, and the very possibility of understanding other people.\r\nComparative Philosophy without Borders demonstrates how drawing on philosophical resources from across cultural traditions can produce sound state-of-the-art progressive philosophy. Fusing the horizons of traditions opens up a space for creative conceptual thinking outside all sorts of boxes."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In this study, we investigated the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry (Pol-SAR) and a supervised classification technique, support vector machine (SVM), for the classification of bare soil, ice, and snow, over the Ortles\u2013Cevedale massif, (Eastern Italian Alps). We analyzed the importance of topographic correction on the backscattering and polarimetric SAR signature and the advantage of quad-pol with respect to dual-pol data. When backscattering values only are employed, the incidence angle used as input feature of the SVM classifier assures the best classification accuracy, 9.9% higher than the accuracy obtained with cosine corrected \u03b30 backscattering. The introduction of polarimetric features and decomposition parameters (such as Cloude\u2013Pottier or Touzi decomposition parameters) increases the classification accuracy by 5.2% with respect to the backscattering case. The simulation of RADARSAT-2 data as Sentinel-1 like for dual-pol data shows a decrease of accuracy equal to 7.8% with respect to the fully polarimetric case (93.5%). The first Sentinel-1 image acquired on our test area was also employed for classification. We then tested the capability of C-band SAR to detect accumulation and ablation zones of the glaciers under the winter dry snow by setting up a multi-incidence angle and fully polarimetric SVM classifier, exploiting ascending and descending RADARSAT- 2 data. In this case, the accuracy increased by 14.7% combining different geometric acquisitions (88.9%) with respect to the single geometry case. Finally, from the resulting classification maps, we extracted the snowline altitude for a sample of three glaciers, using both optical and SAR data, comparing the different products."

      "Introduction and objectives\r\nResearch highlights the importance of identifying and examining crucial meeting characteristics and procedures. Thus, the aim of the present research is to develop and validate the Zurich Meeting Questionnaire (ZMQ), an instrument that assesses meeting attendees\u2019 perceptions of meeting design characteristics and task- and relational-oriented procedures during the meeting.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nThree independent samples (n1 = 474, n2 = 464, n3 = 311) were used to test the psychometric properties, factorial structure, criterion validity, and construct validity of the ZMQ.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nResults of confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the assumed two-dimensional structure of meeting procedures. Furthermore, the results provided criterion validity evidence regarding meeting satisfaction and perceived meeting effectiveness. Finally, the pattern of correlations with external variables (team climate inventory, psychological safety, and social desirability) provided initial evidence of construct validity.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe ZMQ is a short and psychometrically sound measure of meeting design characteristics and procedures during meetings and is suitable for use in organizational research and the evaluation of meetings in practice.\r\n\r\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\r\nIntroduction et objectifs\r\nLa recherche souligne l\u2019importance d\u2019identifier et d\u2019examiner les caract\u00e9ristiques et les proc\u00e9dures cruciales des r\u00e9unions. Ainsi, le but de la pr\u00e9sente recherche consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper et \u00e0 valider un instrument (Zurich Meeting Questionnaire [ZMQ]) permettant d\u2019\u00e9valuer les perceptions des participants d\u2019une r\u00e9union concernant les caract\u00e9ristiques de la conception de la r\u00e9union et les proc\u00e9dures relatives aux t\u00e2ches et aux aspects relationnels au cours de la r\u00e9union.\r\n\r\nM\u00e9thode\r\nTrois \u00e9chantillons ind\u00e9pendants (n1 = 474, n2 = 464, n3 = 311) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour tester les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s psychom\u00e9triques, la structure factorielle, la validit\u00e9 de crit\u00e8re, et la validit\u00e9 de construit des \u00e9chelles nouvellement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es.\r\n\r\nR\u00e9sultats\r\nLes analyses factorielles ont confirm\u00e9 la assum\u00e9e structure bidimensionnelle des proc\u00e9dures de r\u00e9union.

    ],
    "description": [
      "Some scientifically well-established results\u2014such as the fact that emission of greenhouse gases produces global warming\u2014are rejected by sizable proportions of the population in the United States and other countries. Rejection of scientific findings is mostly driven by motivated cognition: People tend to reject findings that threaten their core beliefs or worldview. At present, rejection of scientific findings by the U.S. public is more prevalent on the political right than the left. Yet the cognitive mechanisms driving rejection of science, such as the superficial processing of evidence toward the desired interpretation, are found regardless of political orientation. General education and scientific literacy do not mitigate rejection of science but, rather, increase the polarization of opinions along partisan lines. In contrast, specific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying a scientific result\u2014such as human-made climate change\u2014can increase the acceptance of that result."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present research examines descriptive models of probabilistic conditional reasoning, that is of reasoning from uncertain conditionals with contents about which reasoners have rich background knowledge. According to our dual-source model, two types of information shape such reasoning: knowledge-based information elicited by the contents of the material and content-independent information derived from the form of inferences. Two experiments implemented manipulations that selectively influenced the model parameters for the knowledge-based information, the relative weight given to form-based versus knowledge-based information, and the parameters for the form-based information, validating the psychological interpretation of these parameters. We apply the model to classical suppression effects dissecting them into effects on background knowledge and effects on form-based processes (Exp. 3) and we use it to reanalyse previous studies manipulating reasoning instructions. In a model-comparison exercise, based on data of seven studies, the dual-source model outperformed three Bayesian competitor models. Overall, our results support the view that people make use of background knowledge in line with current Bayesian models, but they also suggest that the form of the conditional argument, irrespective of its content, plays a substantive, yet smaller, role."

      "Harsh discipline relates to internalizing problems and cognitive functioning: findings from a cross-sectional study with school children in Tanzania"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Background: Child maltreatment poses a risk to children and adolescents\u2019 mental health and may also affect cognitive functioning. Also harsh discipline has been frequently associated with mental health problems. However, within societies in which harsh disciplinary methods are culturally normed and highly prevalent less is known about the association between harsh punishment, mental health problems, and cognitive functioning.\r\nMethods: In a cross-sectional study, we conducted structured clinical interviews with a sample of Tanzanian primary school students assessing exposure to harsh discipline (Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure), internalizing problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, Children\u2019s Depression Inventory), and working memory (Corsi Blocktapping Task). School performance was measured by using the exam grades in 4 core subjects. The 409 children (52 % boys) had a mean age of 10.5 years (range: 6 \u2013 15).\r\nResults: Using structural equation modeling, a strong relationship was found between harsh discipline and internalizing problems (\u03b2 = .47), which were related to lower working memory capacity (\u03b2 = \u2212.17) and school performance (\u03b2 = \u2212.17).\r\nConclusions: The present study suggests that harsh discipline is closely linked to children\u2019s internalizing mental health problems, which are in turn associated with lower cognitive functioning and school performance. Given the high rates of harsh discipline experienced by children in East African homes and elsewhere, the findings of the present study emphasize the need to inform the population at large about the potentially adverse consequences associated with harsh discipline."

      "The limits of democratization through a regional hegemon: South African linkage and leverage and the skewed playing field in Lesotho party competition"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This article has two aims: First, it examines the effect of a democratic and non-Western regional hegemon on democratization processes in neighboring countries, applied to the case of South Africa and its influence on democratization in Lesotho. Second, it applies Levitsky and Way\u2019s framework to the case of Lesotho. The results of the analysis attenuate optimism about the potential of democratic non-Western regional hegemons to replace missing Western linkage and induce full democratization in neighboring countries. The analysis shows there is high linkage and leverage between South Africa and Lesotho according to Levitsky and Way\u2019s measurement. Yet the 2012 turnover through elections in Lesotho turns out to be a sign of unstable competitive authoritarianism, rather than an indication of an evolution towards full democratization, i.e. it is the result of high Western and South African leverage, low Western linkage, and low organizational power of the incumbent party. A qualitative assessment of linkage between South Africa and Lesotho shows that linkage between the two countries is not as dense as suggested by the measurement according to Levitsky and Way\u2019s criteria. This calls into question whether their measurement criteria for linkage actually reflect their own hypothesized role of linkage."

      "Party politics and education spending: challenging some common wisdom"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Much literature has analysed parties\u2019 influence on public education spending. We challenge this literature on theoretical, methodological and empirical grounds. It is standard to regress expenditure on cabinet seat-share weighted party family dummies in time-series cross-section regressions using \u2018country-year\u2019 data. But using \u2018country-year\u2019 data artificially inflates the number of cases and leads to biased estimates, as governments usually do not change annually. Second, using party families as proxies for party preferences assumes that parties within families hold similar positions while they differ across families. But this is empirically often not the case. Finally, a historical institutionalist perspective suggests that we should not expect party effects anymore in the first place. Empirically, we propose a new design, using direct measures of party preferences in analyses on government-term level. We find that the partisan composition of government did not have any significant effects on education spending from 1995 to 2010 in 21 democracies."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This book analyzes the political economy of higher education finance across a range of OECD countries, exploring why some students pay extortionate tuition fees whilst for others their education is free. What are the redistributional consequences of these different tuition-subsidy systems? Analysing the variety of existing systems, Garritzmann shows that across the advanced democracies \u201cFour Worlds of Student Finance\u201d exist. Historically, however, all countries\u2019 higher education systems looked very much alike in the 1940s. The book develops a theoretical model, the Time-Sensitive Partisan Theory, to explain why countries have evolved from a similar historical starting point to today\u2019s very distinct Four Worlds. The empirical analyses combine a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative evidence, studying higher education policies in all advanced democracies from 1945-2015."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Self-control is key to success in life. Initial acts of self-control temporarily impair subsequent self-control performance. Why such self-control failures occur is unclear, with prominent models postulating a loss of a limited resource vs a loss of motivation, respectively. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates of motivation-induced benefits on self-control. Participants initially exerted or did not exert self-control. In a subsequent Stroop task, participants performed worse after exerting self-control, but not if they were motivated to perform well by monetary incentives. On the neural level, having exerted self-control resulted in decreased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Increasing motivation resulted in a particularly strong activation of this area specifically after exerting self-control. Thus, after self-control exertion participants showed more prefrontal neural activity without improving performance beyond baseline level. These findings suggest that impaired performance after self-control exertion may not exclusively be due to a loss of motivation."

      "OBJECTIVE\r\nAdjustment disorder (AD) is one of the most debated diagnoses in psychiatry since it has been recognised as vaguely defined and causing a lot of difficulties in clinical practice. We aimed to analyse the structure of adjustment disorder based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 proposals by the WHO ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification of Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress in the general population in Lithuania. Three structural models of adjustment disorder were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\nData from the sample of 649\u00a0participants who experienced at least one significant stressor during the last two years was included in CFA analysis. Stressor exposure and AD symptoms were measured with the Lithuanian version of the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM-20).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe CFA analysis revealed that the two core factor model of the AD with two core symptoms: preoccupation and failure to adapt fitted data the best in contrast to other two models.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe study supports the ICD-11 proposal for the structure of adjustment disorder with two core symptoms: preoccupation and failure to adapt. Further studies are needed to analyse the structure of AD in other populations."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The gut microbiota has been established as an important player influencing many aspects of human physiology. Breast milk, the first diet for an infant, contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) that shape the infant's gut microbiota by selectively stimulating the growth of specific bacteria, especially bifidobacteria. In addition to their bifidogenic activity, the ability of HMO to modulate immune function and the gut barrier makes them prime candidates to restore a beneficial microbiota in dysbiotic adults and provide health benefits. We conducted a parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, HMO-supplementation study in 100 healthy, adult volunteers, consuming chemically produced 2'-O-fucosyllactose (2'FL) and/or lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) at various daily doses and mixes or placebo for 2 weeks. All participants completed the study without premature discontinuation. Supplementation of 2'FL and LNnT at daily doses up to 20 g was shown to be safe and well tolerated, as assessed using the gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that HMO supplementation specifically modified the adult gut microbiota with the primary impact being substantial increases in relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium in particular and a reduction in relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. This study provides the first set of data on safety, tolerance and impact of HMO on the adult gut microbiota. Collectively, the results from this study show that supplementing the diet with HMO is a valuable strategy to shape the human gut microbiota and specifically promote the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria."

      "A Multilab Preregistered Replication of the Ego-Depletion Effect"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero (d = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control."

      "Different Resting State EEG Features in Children from Switzerland and Saudi Arabia"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Background: Cultural neuroscience is an emerging research field concerned with studying the influences of different cultures on brain anatomy and function. In this study, we examined whether different cultural or genetic influences might influence the resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) in young children (mean age 10 years) from Switzerland and Saudi Arabia. Methods: Resting state EEG recordings were obtained from relatively large groups of healthy children (95 healthy Swiss children and 102 Saudi Arabian children). These EEG data were analyzed using group independent components analyses (gICA) and conventional analyses of spectral data, together with estimations of the underlying intracortical sources, using LORETA software. Results: We identified many similarities, but also some substantial differences with respect to the resting state EEG data. For Swiss children, we found stronger delta band power values in mesial frontal areas and stronger power values in three out of four frequency bands in occipital areas. For Saudi Arabian children, we uncovered stronger alpha band power over the sensorimotor cortex. The additionally measured theta/beta ratio (TBR) was similar for Swiss and Saudi Arabian children. Conclusions: The different EEG resting state features identified, are discussed in the context of different cultural experiences and possible genetic influences. In addition, we emphasize the importance of using appropriate EEG databases when comparing resting state EEG features between groups."

      "Amygdala and auditory cortex exhibit distinct sensitivity to relevant acoustic features of auditory emotions"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Discriminating between auditory signals of different affective value is critical to successful social interaction. It is commonly held that acoustic decoding of such signals occurs in the auditory system, whereas affective decoding occurs in the amygdala. However, given that the amygdala receives direct subcortical projections that bypass the auditory cortex, it is possible that some acoustic decoding occurs in the amygdala as well, when the acoustic features are relevant for affective discrimination. We tested this hypothesis by combining functional neuroimaging with the neurophysiological phenomena of repetition suppression (RS) and repetition enhancement (RE) in human listeners. Our results show that both amygdala and auditory cortex responded differentially to physical voice features, suggesting that the amygdala and auditory cortex decode the affective quality of the voice not only by processing the emotional content from previously processed acoustic features, but also by processing the acoustic features themselves, when these are relevant to the identification of the voice's affective value. Specifically, we found that the auditory cortex is sensitive to spectral high-frequency voice cues when discriminating vocal anger from vocal fear and joy, whereas the amygdala is sensitive to vocal pitch when discriminating between negative vocal emotions (i.e., anger and fear). Vocal pitch is an instantaneously recognized voice feature, which is potentially transferred to the amygdala by direct subcortical projections. These results together provide evidence that, besides the auditory cortex, the amygdala too processes acoustic information, when this is relevant to the discrimination of auditory emotions."

    ],
    "description": [
      "While it has been acknowledged that convergence is a multidimensional phenomenon, the convergence of media production processes has received little attention from researchers so far. In this article, we address this research gap with a qualitative study of production processes in different types of media. Our starting point is that independent of the media type, common product characteristics can be identified, that promote success in the audience market. We ask whether the same is true for process characteristics; whether there are converged processes that promote audience success independent of the media type. The study is based on n = 39 interviews in the German-speaking markets. Our findings provide a differentiated result: We do find similarities in the processes along the lines of product characteristics; however, the project phase is an important influencer. While processes in the development phase are more converged, production and distribution still demand distinct processes for different media types. In general, we can confirm studies that find a reluctance of media practitioners towards convergence, which often remains an underfunded and cost-oriented brain child of the top management."

      "The present study replicated and extended research concerning a recently suggested conceptual model of the underlying factors of dimension ratings in assessment centers (ACs) proposed by Hoffman, Melchers, Blair, Kleinmann, and Ladd that includes broad dimension factors, exercise factors, and a general performance factor. We evaluated the criterion-related validity of these different components and expanded their nomological network. Results showed that all components (i.e., broad dimensions, exercises, general performance) were significant predictors of training performance. Furthermore, broad dimensions showed incremental validity beyond exercises and general performance. Finally, relationships between the AC factors and individual difference constructs (e.g., Big Five, core self-evaluations, positive and negative affectivity) supported the construct-related validity of broad dimensions and provided further insights in the nature of the different AC components."

      "This article addresses the encounters of second-generation Eritreans with a new generation of refugees from Eritrea in Switzerland and identifies two main types of encounter: direct personal encounters and indirect in the public discourse. It suggests that the recently arrived Eritrean refugees present a new actor within the translocal social field with whom the second-generation Eritreans have to renegotiate their relation.We argue that these encounters frame the second-generation Eritreans\u2019 positionality within the translocal social field and influence their identity and their affiliation towards Eritrea and Eritreans. We find that encounters between second-generation Eritreans and new Eritrean arrivals are crucial moments through which second-generation Eritreans form their hybrid identity. Thus, the paper contributes to the debate on identity formation of the second generation by adopting a translocal perspective and provides insights into the diversity in the Eritrean diaspora in Switzerland."

      "How socialization attenuates tax competition"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Tax competition is the quintessential example of policy interdependence. The general idea is that tax changes in one jurisdiction lead to similar changes in others. However, research has shown that institutional and political constraints limit competition. This article develops another argument: that socialization among policy makers attenuates competitive dynamics by setting limits to the extent of competition that is considered acceptable. Using fine-grained Swiss data and spatial econometric techniques, it shows that personal income tax rates are more strongly correlated among competitors that do not participate in the same intergovernmental organizations. This finding implies that, to some extent, the detrimental consequences of competition can be mitigated by fostering institutionalized forms of interaction among policy makers."

Taken together, these recommendations trace a distinctive way forward for policy diffusion research."

      "Problems (and solutions) in the measurement of policy diffusion mechanisms"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A growing literature in public policy, comparative politics and international relations has studied how the policies of one unit (e.g. country, federal state or city) are influenced by the policies of other units \u2013 that is, how policies diffuse. This article provides a meta-analysis of 114 studies, demonstrating persisting inconsistencies in the measurement of the mechanisms driving policy diffusion processes. Different indicators are used to measure the same mechanism, and the same indicators are used to measure different mechanisms. To improve this state of affairs, this article puts forward a conceptual structure that serves as a guide for the application of diffusion arguments, a starting point for theoretical refinement and a benchmark to assess measurement validity. In addition to paying more attention to the conceptual consistency of indicators, overcoming the problems currently found in the literature requires the construction of original, innovative research designs instead of the replication of widely used templates."

      "In response to recent media controversy and public debate about legal pluralism and multiculturalism, Manea argues against what she identifies as the growing tendency for people to be treated as 'homogenous groups' in Western academic discourse, rather than as individuals with authentic voices. Building on her knowledge of the situation for women in Middle Eastern and Islamic countries, she undertakes first-hand analysis of the Islamic shari'a councils and Muslim arbitration tribunals in various British cities. Based on meetings with the leading sheikhs - including the only woman on their panels - as well as interviews with experts on extremism, lawyers and activists in civil society and women's rights groups, Manea offers an impassioned critique of legal pluralism, connecting it with political Islam and detailing the lived experiences of women in Muslim communities."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article argues that blasphemy laws and a cultural relativist approach to human rights have a political function in authoritarian states. Islamic states use a strong cultural relativist approach to justify their dismal human rights record. The main aim of this approach, however, is survival. The article shows how Islamic countries use religion for their own political survival purposes and how blasphemy laws are often used to silence critique of political, social and religious orders that infringe on basic human rights. From this perspective, blasphemy laws are tools of oppression, not a symbol of cultural and religious difference. By highlighting how blasphemy laws and a cultural relativist approach to religion have been used as tools of oppression by authoritarian regimes, the article underscores the importance of freedom of expression for any functioning democracy."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article argues that much of the postmodern discourse on the Muslim woman and her veil is symptomatic of what I call the \u201cessentialist paradigm\u201d. The world is seen through the prism of a group\u2019s religious/cultural identity and eventually constructs a Muslim identity \u2013 and with it an image of the Muslim Woman. The image of the oppressed veiled Muslim Woman and the treatment of a piece of cloth as synonymous with her whole identity and being are products of this paradigm of thought. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines discourse analysis and a case study of the construction of the British Muslim community, this article argues that the essentialist paradigm ignores the context of its subject matter with all its accompanying power structures, political and social factors, and the roles played by both the state and fundamentalist Islam in constructing a Muslim identity and with it the Muslim Woman and her dress code."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND\r\nStrategies to improve the life of patients suffering from recurrent major depression have a high relevance. This study examined the efficacy of 2 Internet-delivered augmentation strategies that aim to prolong symptom-free intervals.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nEfficacy was tested in a 3-arm, multicenter, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomized controlled trial. Upon discharge from inpatient mental health care, 232 adults with 3 or more major depressive episodes were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups (SUMMIT or SUMMIT-PERSON) or to treatment as usual (TAU) alone. Over 12 months, participants in both intervention arms received, in addition to TAU, intense monitoring via e-mail or a smartphone, including signaling of upcoming crises, assistance with personal crisis management, and facilitation of early intervention. SUMMIT-PERSON additionally offered regular expert chats. The primary outcome was 'well weeks', i.e. weeks with at most mild symptoms assessed by the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation, during 24 months after the index treatment.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nSUMMIT compared to TAU reduced the time with an unwell status (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23-0.98) through faster transitions from unwell to well (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.83-2.50) and slower transitions from well to unwell (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.44-1.09). Contrary to the hypothesis, SUMMIT-PERSON was not superior to either SUMMIT (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.38-1.56) or TAU (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.31-1.24). The efficacy of SUMMIT was strongest 8 months after the intervention.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThe fully automated Internet-delivered augmentation strategy SUMMIT has the potential to improve TAU by reducing the lifelong burden of patients with recurrent depression. The fact that the effects wear off suggests a time-unlimited extension."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The goal of the present study was to test the influence of the spatial and temporal dynamics of observed manual actions on infants' action prediction. Twelve-month-old infants were presented with reach-and-transport actions performed by a human agent. Movement distance, duration, and - resulting from the two - movement velocity were systematically varied. Action prediction was measured via the latency of gaze arrival at target in relation to agent's hand. The results showed a general effect of all parameters on the infants' perception of goal-directed actions: Infants were more likely to predict the action goal the longer the movement distance was, the longer the movement duration was, and the slower the movement velocity was. In addition, they were more likely to predict the goal of a reaching than a transport action. The present findings extent previous findings by showing that infants are not only sensitive to differences in distances, durations, and velocities at early age but that these factors have a strong impact on the prediction of the goal of observed actions."

      "The \"silent\" imprint of musical training"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Playing a musical instrument at a professional level is a complex multimodal task requiring information integration between different brain regions supporting auditory, somatosensory, motor, and cognitive functions. These kinds of task-specific activations are known to have a profound influence on both the functional and structural architecture of the human brain. However, until now, it is widely unknown whether this specific imprint of musical practice can still be detected during rest when no musical instrument is used. Therefore, we applied high-density electroencephalography and evaluated whole-brain functional connectivity as well as small-world topologies (i.e., node degree) during resting state in a sample of 15 professional musicians and 15 nonmusicians. As expected, musicians demonstrate increased intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity between those brain regions that are typically involved in music perception and production, such as the auditory, the sensorimotor, and prefrontal cortex as well as Broca's area. In addition, mean connectivity within this specific network was positively related to musical skill and the total number of training hours. Thus, we conclude that musical training distinctively shapes intrinsic functional network characteristics in such a manner that its signature can still be detected during a task-free condition.

      "Differences in Cortical Representation and Structural Connectivity of Hands and Feet between Professional Handball Players and Ballet Dancers"
    ],
    "description": [
      "It is known that intensive training and expertise are associated with functional and structural neuroadaptations. Most studies, however, compared experts with nonexperts; hence it is, specifically for sports, unclear whether the neuroplastic adaptations reported are sport-specific or sport-general. Here we aimed at investigating sport-specific adaptations in professional handball players and ballet dancers by focusing on the primary motor and somatosensory grey matter (GM) representation of hands and feet using voxel-based morphometry as well as on fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corticospinal tract by means of diffusion tensor imaging-based fibre tractography. As predicted, GM volume was increased in hand areas of handball players, whereas ballet dancers showed increased GM volume in foot areas. Compared to handball players, ballet dancers showed decreased FA in both fibres connecting the foot and hand areas, but they showed lower FA in fibres connecting the foot compared to their hand areas, whereas handball players showed lower FA in fibres connecting the hand compared to their foot areas. Our results suggest that structural adaptations are sport-specific and are manifested in brain regions associated with the neural processing of sport-specific skills. We believe this enriches the plasticity research in general and extends our knowledge of sport expertise in particular."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Going beyond the relation of work and family, the present three-wave longitudinal study spanning one year assessed different forms of conflict and facilitation between leisure and the life domains work and family and their relation to subjective well-being. A sample of N\u2009=\u2009277 employed men and women reported their perceived conflict and facilitation between leisure, work, and family and subjective well-being. Results suggest that leisure is a source of facilitation for work and family, and, at the same time, a major recipient of conflict from work and family. Moreover, leisure conflict was negatively correlated and leisure facilitation was positively associated with concurrent subjective well-being. Both conflict and facilitation between all three life domains remained highly stable over the course of one year. Only few and non-systematic lagged effects were found, indicating that the variance of the stability of the constructs and their relations over time leave little room for longitudinal predictions. Taken together, the study demonstrates that, similar to work\u2013family relations, conflict and facilitation with the leisure domain are also associated with subjective well-being and remain highly stable over the course of a year in the lives of young and middle-aged adults."

      "Early testing of new sanitation technology for urban slums: The case of the Blue Diversion Toilet"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The toilets used most in informal urban settlements have detrimental consequences for the environment and human health due to the lack of proper collection and treatment of toilet waste. Concepts for safe, sustainable and affordable sanitation systems exist, but their feasibility and acceptance have to be investigated at an early stage of development, which is difficult due to the high costs of building working models. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate acceptance in a valid and representative form with only one working model, and apply it to test an innovative zero-emission toilet with recycling of wash water. Four basic principles were specified for investigation and nine hypotheses formulated to test the feasibility and acceptance of these principles: source separation of urine and feces with subsequent collection for resource recovery; provision of wash water in a separate cycle with on-site recovery through a membrane bioreactor; a convenient and attractive overall design; and a financially sustainable business plan. In Kampala (Uganda), in 2013, data was collected from 22 regular users, 308 one-time users and a representative sample of 1538 participants. Qualitative data was collected from the users, who evaluated their likes, perceived benefits, social norms and expected ease of use based on verbal and visual information. Most of the hypotheses were confirmed, indicating the feasibility and acceptance of the basic principles. Source separation and on-site water recovery were found to be feasible and accepted, provided users can be convinced that the emptying service and water recovery process work reliably. In the survey, the toilet was evaluated favorably and 51% of the participants agreed to be placed on a bogus waiting list. However, some design challenges were revealed, such as the size of the toilet, hiding feces from view and improving the separation of urine and water."

      "Broca Pars Triangularis constitutes a \u201cHub\u201d of the language-control network during simultaneous language translation"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Until now, several branches of research have fundamentally contributed to a better understanding of the ramifications of bilingualism, multilingualism, and language expertise on psycholinguistic-, cognitive-, and neural implications. In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that from a cognitive perspective, there is a strong convergence of data pointing to an influence of multilingual speech competence on a variety of cognitive functions, including attention, short-term- and working memory, set shifting, switching, and inhibition. In addition, complementary neuroimaging findings have highlighted a specific set of cortical and subcortical brain regions which fundamentally contribute to administrate cognitive control in the multilingual brain, namely Broca's area, the middle-anterior cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal lobe, and the basal ganglia. However, a disadvantage of focusing on group analyses is that this procedure only enables an approximation of the neural networks shared within a population while at the same time smoothing inter-individual differences. In order to address both commonalities (i.e., within group analyses) and inter-individual variability (i.e., single-subject analyses) in language control mechanisms, here I measured five professional simultaneous interpreters while the participants overtly translated or repeated sentences with a simple subject-verb-object structure. Results demonstrated that pars triangularis was commonly activated across participants during backward translation (i.e., from L2 to L1), whereas the other brain regions of the \"control network\" showed a strong inter-individual variability during both backward and forward (i.e., from L1 to L2) translation. Thus, I propose that pars triangularis plays a crucial role within the language-control network and behaves as a fundamental processing entity supporting simultaneous language translation."

      "Functional Connectivity in the Left Dorsal Stream Facilitates Simultaneous Language Translation: An EEG Study"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Cortical speech processing is dependent on the mutual interdependence of two distinctive processing streams supporting sound-to-meaning (i.e., ventral stream) and sound-to-articulation (i.e., dorsal stream) mapping. Here, we compared the strengths of intracranial functional connectivity between two main hubs of the dorsal stream, namely the left auditory-related cortex (ARC) and Broca's region, in a sample of simultaneous interpreters (SIs) and multilingual control subjects while the participants performed a mixed and unmixed auditory semantic decision task. Under normal listening conditions such kind of tasks are known to initiate a spread of activation along the ventral stream. However, due to extensive and specific training, here we predicted that SIs will more strongly recruit the dorsal pathway in order to pre-activate the speech codes of the corresponding translation. In line with this reasoning, EEG results demonstrate increased left-hemispheric theta phase synchronization in SLI compared to multilingual control participants during early task-related processing stages. In addition, within the SI group functional connectivity strength in the left dorsal pathway was positively related to the cumulative number of training hours across lifespan, and inversely correlated with the age of training commencement. Hence, we propose that the alignment of neuronal oscillations between brain regions involved in \"hearing\" and \"speaking\" results from an intertwining of training, sensitive period, and predisposition."

    ],
    "description": [
      "We study the impact of international long-distance flights on the global spatial allocation of economic activity. To identify causal effects, we exploit variation due to regulatory and technological constraints which give rise to a discontinuity in connectedness between cities at a distance of 6000 miles. We show that these air links have a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. To shed light on how air links shape economic outcomes, we first present evidence of positive externalities in the global network of air links: connections induce further connections. We then find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing interconnectedness generates economic activity at the local level by inducing links between businesses, but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This paper analyzes the developmental origins and the evolution of health, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills during early childhood, from age 0 to 5. We explicitly model the dynamic interactions of health with the child\u2019s behavior and cognitive skills, as well as the role of parental investment. A dynamic factor model corrects for the presence of measurement error in the proxy for the latent traits. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we find that children\u2019s capabilities strongly interact and build on each other: health is an important determinant of early socio-emotional development; in turn socio-emotional skills have a positive impact on the evolution of both health and cognitive functions; on the other side, the effect of cognitive abilities on health is negligible. Furthermore, all facets of human capital display a high degree of persistence. Finally, mother\u2019s investments are an important determinant of the child\u2019s health, cognitive, and socio-emotional development early in life."

      "Mind the Gap? An Intensive Longitudinal Study of Between-Person and Within-Person Intention-Behavior Relations"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND\r\nDespite their good intentions, people often do not eat healthily. This is known as the intention-behavior gap. Although the intention-behavior relationship is theorized as a within-person process, most evidence is based on between-person differences.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE\r\nThe purpose of the present study is to investigate the within-person intention-behavior association for unhealthy snack consumption.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nYoung adults (N\u2009=\u200945) participated in an intensive longitudinal study. They reported intentions and snack consumption five times daily for 7\u00a0days (n\u2009=\u20091068 observations analyzed).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nA within-person unit difference in intentions was associated with a halving of the number of unhealthy snacks consumed in the following 3\u00a0h (CI95 27-70\u00a0%). Between-person differences in average intentions did not predict unhealthy snack consumption.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nConsistent with theory, the intention-behavior relation for healthy eating is best understood as a within-person process. Interventions to reduce unhealthy snacking should target times of day when intentions are weakest."

      "Action control in dyads: A randomized controlled trial to promote physical activity in everyday life"
    ],
    "description": [
      "RATIONALE\r\nEngaging in regular physical activity requires substantial self-regulatory effort such as action control (e.g., continuously monitoring and evaluating an ongoing behavior with regard to one's standards).\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\nThe present study examined the effectiveness of an ecological momentary action control intervention for promoting daily physical activity. Also, we tested whether a dyadic compared to an individual intervention displayed an additional benefit.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n121 overweight and obese individuals and their partners were randomly allocated to an intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a060; information\u00a0+\u00a0action control text messages) or a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a061; information only). The intervention was delivered in a dyadic vs. individual version of action control. Allocation ratio was 1:1:2 for the dyadic, individual, and control groups, respectively. Daily physical activity was assessed with triaxial accelerometers during a 14-day intervention phase and a 14-day follow-up phase.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nParticipants in the intervention group showed a higher probability (36.5%) to achieve the recommended daily activity levels (\u226530\u00a0min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day performed in bouts of at least 10\u00a0min) during the intervention and follow-up phase compared to those in the control group (23.0%). The intervention and control group did not differ in terms of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (40.7 vs. 38.6\u00a0min per day, p\u00a0=\u00a00.623).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nInterventions facilitating action control via text messages seem to be an effective tool for increasing adherence to physical activity guidelines in everyday life. The comparable effects for the dyadic and individual intervention suggest that automated text messages may be just as effective as personalized messages from the romantic partner. Further investigation is needed to examine the usefulness of a dyadic conceptualizing of action control. (controlled-trials.com ISRCTN15705531)."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND\r\nSocial support that goes unnoticed by receivers (i.e. invisible support) seems to be most beneficial for the receivers' well-being. The providers' well-being, however, has been neglected so far. This study examines how invisible support is related to the providers' well-being and whether this association is dependent on the providers' relationship satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nOverall, 97 non-smoking partners of smokers who were about to quit smoking were examined. Invisible support was assessed dyadically: partners' reports on smoking-specific provided social support together with smokers' reports on received support were assessed at baseline. Partners' relationship satisfaction was also assessed at baseline. Partners' positive and negative affect were measured at baseline and six-week follow-up.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nNo main effects of invisible instrumental or emotional support occurred. However, partners' relationship satisfaction moderated the association between invisible instrumental support and change in partners' negative and positive affect: For partners with lower relationship satisfaction more invisible instrumental support was related to increased negative affect and decreased positive affect, whereas for partners with higher relationship satisfaction the inverse effects occurred.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThe study's results emphasise that invisible instrumental support might have emotional costs for the providers. Relationship satisfaction seems to serve as a protective factor."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The current article details a position statement and recommendations for future research and practice on planning and implementation intentions in health contexts endorsed by the Synergy Expert Group. The group comprised world-leading researchers in health and social psychology and behavioural medicine who convened to discuss priority issues in planning interventions in health contexts and develop a set of recommendations for future research and practice. The expert group adopted a nominal groups approach and voting system to elicit and structure priority issues in planning interventions and implementation intentions research. Forty-two priority issues identified in initial discussions were further condensed to 18 key issues, including definitions of planning and implementation intentions and 17 priority research areas. Each issue was subjected to voting for consensus among group members and formed the basis of the position statement and recommendations. Specifically, the expert group endorsed statements and recommendations in the following areas: generic definition of planning and specific definition of implementation intentions, recommendations for better testing of mechanisms, guidance on testing the effects of moderators of planning interventions, recommendations on the social aspects of planning interventions, identification of the preconditions that moderate effectiveness of planning interventions and recommendations for research on how people use plans."

      "Research on age differences in implicit motives is rare and has shown contradictory results. We investigated age and gender differences in implicit motives (achievement, power, affiliation and intimacy), measured by the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), in an extensive, heterogeneous dyadic sample of 736 adults aged 20\u201380 years. Data were analyzed with a multilevel approach. Results indicate lower motive scores in all four measured motives in aged as compared to young adults but higher scores in activity inhibition. Further, women scored higher in affiliation and intimacy motives than men, while men scored higher in achievement and power motives and in activity inhibition than women. Possible underlying affective and neuroendocrinological processes of age dependent change in implicit motives are discussed."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The past years have seen a growing interest in the study of positive psychology interventions. Meta-analytic ev- idence suggests that they are effective in enhancing happiness and ameliorating depression. However, far less is known on why and how they work. We test two proposed working mechanisms: An attentional shift to the pos- itive, and savoring positive emotions. The proposed mechanisms are tested by manipulating the time focus (past, present, or future) in the instruction of a one-week online humor-based positive intervention (three funny things). A sample of 695 adults was randomly assigned to one of the intervention condition or a placebo control condition. All three variants were effective in enhancing happiness and ameliorating depressive symptoms from pre- to post-intervention compared to the placebo control condition. As expected, the present variant was asso- ciated with both mechanisms, while the past variant was more strongly associated with the savoring mechanism, and the future variant more strongly with the attentional shift mechanism. This initial study provides first sup- port for the potential working mechanisms of effective positive interventions."

      "The circular structure of values: The case of China"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This study examined the circular structure of values in China. The circular structure is a central element of Schwartz value theory and visualises the idea that some values are similar while others conflict with one another. Whereas numerous studies addressed the question whether the circular structure of values can be generalised cross-culturally, results for China are inconclusive. In this paper, we argue that taking a closer look at China provides a challenge to the circular structure and allows for drawing conclusions regarding the limits versus generalizability of Schwartz' theory. For this purpose, we first conduct a re-analysis of Chinese data from a former meta-analysis (Study 1) and second, present results from a large study of 10,652 Chinese college students (Study 2). Results of Study 1 revealed that graphical representation of the circular structure matched theoretical expectations but five out of six samples showed relatively bad fit to the theorised structure. By contrast, data in Study 2 showed a good model fit. As an overall conclusion, the circular structure is well supported in the Chinese context, and small sample sizes in previous studies might have caused the imperfect match to the prototypical circular structure."

      "For political scientists, it is increasingly important to explore large text collections without time-consuming human intervention. We are presenting a language technology tool kit that allows political scientists to extract information on various forms of governance from a comprehensive multilingual corpus. The tool kit allows searching for governance entities and measuring their salience, tonality and media frames. In substantial terms, our pipeline enables scholars of governance to extend their research focus to the previously neglected area of public communication."

      "Emotional and behavioral problems in late preterm and early term births: outcomes at child age 36 months"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Recent findings has shown that late preterm births (gestational weeks 34-36) and early term births (gestational weeks 37-38) is associated with an increased risk of several psychological and developmental morbidities. In this article we investigate whether late preterm and early term births is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems at 36\u00a0months of age and whether there are gender differences in risk of these outcomes.\r\nMETHODS: Forty-three thousand, two hundred ninety-seven children and their mothers participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). One thousand, eight hundred fifty-three (4.3%) of the children in the sample were born late preterm and 7,835 (18.1%) were born early term. Information on gestational age and on prenatal and postnatal risk factors was retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Information on emotional and behavioral problems was assessed by standardized questionnaires (CBCL/ITSEA) filled out by the mothers. Gender-stratified logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between late preterm / early term and emotional and behavioral problems at 36\u00a0months of age.\r\nRESULTS: We found a gender-specific increased risk of emotional problems in girls born late preterm (OR 1.47 95%CI 1.11-1.95) and in girls born early term (OR 1.21 95%CI 1.04-1.42). We did not find an increased risk of emotional problems in boys born late preterm (OR 1.09 95%CI 0.82-1.45) or early term (OR 0.93 95%CI 0.79-1.10). Behavioral problems were not increased in children born late preterm or early term.\r\nCONCLUSION: Girls born late preterm and early term show an increased risk of emotional problems at 36\u00a0months of age. This finding suggests that gender should be taken into account when evaluating children born at these gestational ages."

      "Does medical risk perception and risk taking change with age?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Across adulthood, people face increasingly more risky medical problems and decisions. However, little is known about changes in medical risk taking across adulthood. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in medical risk taking with N = 317 adults aged 20-77 years using newly developed scenarios to assess medical risk taking, and additional measures designed to evaluate risk-taking behavior in the medical domain. Greater expected benefits on the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale-Medical (DOSPERT-M) predicted more active risk taking, whereas higher perceived risk predicted less active risk taking. Next, we examined differences in active and passive risk taking, where passive risk taking refers to risk taking that is associated with inaction. Age was associated with less passive risk taking, but not with active risk taking, risk perception, or expected benefits on the DOSPERT-M. Participants were overall more likely to opt for taking medical action than not, even more so for a scenario about a vaccine for a deadly flu than for a scenario about a chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Overall, participants were more likely to accept medication (vaccine or chemotherapy) for their child than for themselves. Increasing age was associated with a lower likelihood of accepting the treatment or vaccine for oneself. Taken together, our study provides important insights about changes in medical risk taking across adulthood when people face an increasing number of complex and risky medical decisions"

A 20-day measurement burst study (N= 89 employed adults, M age = 42) investigated the occurrence and consequences of integration and incongruity of work, family, and leisure in the everyday lives of middle-age adults. Results suggest that subjective well-being and goal relations (lower conflict, higher facilitation among goals) profit from an integration of multiple life domains. In contrast, incongruity between content (activities, thoughts) and context (location) seems to be detrimental for subjective-well being and goal relations of middle-age adults"

      "Motivational shifts in aging monkeys and the origins of social selectivity"
    ],
    "description": [
      "As humans age, they become more selective regarding their personal goals [1] and social partners [2]. Whereas the selectivity in goals has been attributed to losses in resources (e.g., physical strength) [3], the increasing focus on emotionally meaningful partners is, according to socioemotional selectivity theory, driven by the awareness of one's decreasing future lifetime [2]. Similar to humans, aging monkeys show physical losses [4] and reductions in social activity [2, 5-7]. To disentangle a general resource loss and the awareness of decreasing time, we combined field experiments with behavioral observations in a large age-heterogeneous population of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) at La For\u00eat des Singes. Novel object tests revealed a loss of interest in the nonsocial environment in early adulthood, which was modulated by the availability of a food reward. Experiments using vocal and visual representations of social partners indicated that monkeys maintained an interest in social stimuli and a preferential interest in friends and socially important individuals into old age. Old females engaged in fewer social interactions, although other group members continued to invest in relationships with them. Consequently, reductions in sociality were not due to a decrease in social interest. In conclusion, some of the motivational shifts observed in aging humans, particularly the increasing focus on social over nonsocial stimuli, may occur in the absence of a limited time perspective and are most likely deeply rooted in primate evolution. Our findings highlight the value of nonhuman primates as valuable models for understanding human aging [8, 9]"

    ],
    "description": [
      "Beliefs about aging influence how we interpret and respond to changes within and around us. Essentialist beliefs about aging are defined as views that link chronological age with inherent and immutable properties underlying aging-related changes. These beliefs may influence the experience of aging-related changes and shape people's outlook of the future. We hypothesized that people who endorse essentialist beliefs about aging report a more limited future time perspective. Two studies provided correlational (Study 1, N = 250; 18-77 years) and experimental (Study 2, N = 103; 20-77 years) evidence that essentialist beliefs about aging affect people's future time perspective. In addition, Study 2 and Study 3 (N = 174; 34-67 years) tested the underlying mechanism and provided evidence that perception of aging-related threat explains the effect of essentialist beliefs on a reduced future time perspective. These findings highlight the fundamental role of essentialist beliefs about aging for the perception of time horizons in the context of aging"

      "Avalanche fatalities in the European Alps: long-term trends and statistics"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Avalanche accidents, particularly those resulting in fatalities, attract substantial attention from policy makers and organizations, as well as from the media and the public. Placing fatal accidents in a wider context requires long-term and robust statistics. However, avalanche accident statistics, like most other accident statistics, often rely on relatively small sample sizes, with single multi-fatality events and random effects having a potentially large influence on summary and trend statistics. Additionally, trend interpretation is challenging because statistics are generally explored at a national level, and studies vary in both the period covered and the methods. Here, we addressed these issues by combining the avalanche fatality data from the European Alps (Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland) for three different periods between 1937 and 2015 and applying the same data analysis methodology. During the last four decades, about 100 people lost their lives each year in the Alps. Despite considerable inter-annual variation, this number has remained relatively constant in the last decades. However, exploring fatality numbers by the location of the victims at the time of the avalanche revealed two partly opposing trends. The number of fatalities in controlled terrain (settlements and transportation corridors) has decreased significantly since the 1970s. In contrast to this development, the number of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain (mostly recreational accidents) almost doubled between the 1960s and 1980s and has remained relatively stable since then, despite a strong increase in the number of winter backcountry recreationists. Corresponding to these trends, the proportion of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain increased from 72 to 97\u202f%. These long-term trends were evident in most national statistics. Further, the temporal correlation between subsets of the Alpine fatality data, and between some of the national statistics, suggests that time series covering a longer period may be used as an indicator for missing years in shorter-duration datasets. Finally, statistics from countries with very few incidents should be compared to, or analysed together with, those from neighbouring countries exhibiting similar economical and structural developments and characteristics."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Only scarce information is available on how organic C is incorporated into the soil during the decay and how (micro) climate influences this process. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exposure and elevation on the organic litter decomposition and C-stabilisation in acidic soils of an Alpine environment. An experiment with artificially 13C labelled Norway spruce needles was carried out at north- and south-exposed sites between 1200 and 2400 m a.s.l. in the Italian Alps using mesocosms. After 1 year, the 13C recoveries of the bulk soil were 18.6% at the northfacing slopes and 31.5% at the south-facing slopes. A density fractionation into a light (LF; B1.6 g cm-3) and a heavy fraction (HF;[1.6 g cm-3) of the soil helped to identify how the applied substrate was stabilised. At the northern slope, 10.5% of the substrate was recovered in the LF and 8.1% in the HF and at the south-facing slope 22.8% in the LF and 8.1% in the HF. The overall 13C recovery was higher at the south-facing sites due to restricted water availability. Although the climate is humid in the whole area, soil moisture availability becomes more important at south-facing sites due to higher evapotranspiration. However, at sites[1700 m a.s.l, the situation changed, as the northern slope had higher recovery rates. At such altitudes, temperature effects are more dominant. This highlights the importance of locally strongly varying edaphic factors when investigating the carbon cycle."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The author offers a comprehensive portrait of online news performance in Western countries in changing media environments. Drawing on a content analysis of 48 news outlets from different types of media organization in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, and USA, Edda Humprecht investigates the complex interplay of systemic and organizational dynamics and their impact on online news content, showing that the performance of online news media strongly varies among different media outlets. Less profit oriented outlets and those with a focus on information generally perform well offering hard news, diversity, critical distance, or analytical depth. This suggests that the divide between high and low-performing outlets is tied to the news outlet's capacity and willingness to strike a balance between their profit orientation and their normative role as information providers. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that different dimensions of news performance are more pronounced in certain countries. This book provides new theoretical perspectives and methods for political and media scholars, and insights for journalists, policymakers, and concerned citizens."

      "Mapping digital journalism: Comparing 48 news websites from six countries"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Media organizations throughout the Western world struggle to adjust their practices to rapidly changing conditions. Initially, online journalism was celebrated for potentially revolutionizing political reporting due to its new technological possibilities: According to this, it is able to (1) increase transparency by providing hyperlink sources, (2) increase understanding by providing further background information, and (3) add to deliberation and follow-up communication by providing a platform for interactive exchange. A comparative content analysis of 48 news websites from six countries (France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, and United States) examines the degree to which these three potential strengths are fully exploited. By mapping the different news outlets in relation to the digital functions, we identify three models prevalent in different countries and organization types. The first model contains outlets promoting the usage of links to make their sources transparent to the reader (\u2018transparency model\u2019), outlets focusing on the provision of background information to enable their audiences to gain a wider understanding of the reported topic (\u2018background model\u2019), and outlets that mainly avoid the adoption of new technologies (\u2018print-oriented model\u2019). These findings show that different structural developments and professional orientations lead to the adaption of different technologies in digital journalism."

      "Driving Simulator Training Is Associated with Reduced Inhibitory Workload in Older Drivers"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Background: In demanding cognitive tasks, older people mostly experience more problems than younger people, and their brain workload is higher. An overloaded or exhausted mental workload is frequently associated with unsafe driving behavior. In this paper, we hypothesize that 10 active training sessions in a driving simulator positively influence brain workload, which relates to a beneficial increase in on-road driving performance. \r\nMethods: Ninety-one healthy active drivers (62\u201387 years) were randomly assigned to: (a) a driving simulator-training group; (b) an attention-training group; or (c) a control group. The dependent variables of this training study were brain workload (theta Fz/alpha Pz), and performance in three tasks, for which inhibition of inadequate responses (Stroop, Negative Priming, and Flanker) is required. Seventy-seven participants (85% of the total sample) completed the training. Training gains were analyzed by using a multiple regression analysis with planned comparisons. \r\nResults: The results revealed that the driving simulator training reduced brain workload during performance of the inhibition tasks. The performance of the simulator group during the inhibition tasks did not improve, but the participants completed the tasks with less brain workload compared to the attention-training group. \r\nConclusion: Adding to our first paper on the Drive-Wise project, this paper now focuses on the superiority of the driving simulator training, compared to attention-training in regards to reducing brain workload. The change in brain workload seems to be associated with a positive change in drivers\u2019 behavior on the road. Hence, a driving simulator training lasting only ten sessions leads to beneficial neuroplastic changes. This demonstrates brain plasticity of older people and its possible positive influence in real driving behavior."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The article is the revised version of a valedictory lecture given at the University of Lucerne on 21 May 2015. The focus is on religious worldviews. First (1) I circumscribe religious worldviews with a set of three characteristics. Then (2), I defend the thesis that religious worldviews have to be reasonable in order to be good. This reasonableness is specified by three criteria: (2.a) A good religious worldview has to be good not only for me, but also for others insofar as a good worldview does not allow one to kill other people, to make them ill or to discriminate against them because of an accidental human characteristic, such as race, gender, disability or sexual orientation. (2.b) A good religious worldview must allow freedom of faith, conscience and creed. (2.c) A good religious worldview must accept the corroborated results of the natural sciences and the humanities. Finally (3), I emphasize that a good religious worldview has to be good not only for others, but also for me."

    "description": [
      "Research on aging in different domains largely focuses on age-related decrements or intervention-related improvements, often in controlled laboratory conditions or with psychometric tests of maximum ability or traits. This special issue on monitoring and promoting old-age health stabilization in real life focuses on the short-term and long-term age-related stabilization and maintenance in diverse psychological areas, including well-being, self-esteem, subjective health, and social interactions. One central focus in all studies is the clear focus on behaviors in real-life contexts. The papers both review and present ways in which new technologies and research approaches can provide novel opportunities for monitoring and promoting the stabilization of various aspects of health and quality of life in the daily lives of healthy older adults."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Conflict communication represents a basic process for the quality of intimate relationships, which is fundamental to well-being over the lifespan. This study investigates the temporal unfolding of different relational perspectives during a conflict situation by monitoring pronoun use in young, middle-aged, and old couples within the theoretical framework of Gottman\u2019s phases of conflict. Our results reveal different trajectories of \u201cI\u201d-, \u201cyou\u201d-, and \u201cwe\u201d-talk over a conflict conversation in both partners. These trajectories differ between females and males. Furthermore, \u201cyou\u201d-talk and \u201cwe\u201d-talk differed among the age groups over time. Understanding the temporal dynamics of marital communi- cation as reflected by pronoun use seems promising for a better understanding of conflict related processes in couples over the lifespan."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 greatly affected attitudes toward nuclear energy in many countries, including Switzerland. In this study, we analyzed the evolution of public opinion about nuclear energy in Switzerland from 2012 to 2014 to determine how different dimensions of attitudes toward nuclear energy changed in the years following the accident and which factors influenced general opinion about nuclear energy. The primary findings show that public opinion about nuclear energy became only slightly more positive as time passed and that the most important predictor of the general opinion about nuclear energy was the individual assessment of its benefits and risk."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Research on evaluation has mainly focused on the use of evaluation and has given little attention to the origins of evaluation demand. In this article, I consider the question of why parliamentarians demand evaluations with parliamentary requests. Building on the literature of delegation, I use a principal-agent framework to explain the origins of evaluation demand. In doing so, I argue that the parliamentarians mainly demand evaluations in order to hold the government accountable. The quantitative analysis shows that Swiss parliamentarians demand more evaluations if they have the impression that the administration does not implement the policies within their meaning. This finding suggests that parliamentarians demand evaluations in order to fulfill their oversight function towards the government. This conclusion could be relevant in order to understand the role of evaluations within the parliamentary arena."

    "description": [
      "The Paris Climate Agreement is an important step for international climate policy, but the compensation for negative effects of climate change based on clear assignment of responsibilities remains highly debated. From both a policy and a science perspective, it is unclear how responsibilities should be defined and on what evidence base. We explore different normative principles of justice relevant to climate change impacts, and ask how different forms of causal evidence of impacts drawn from detection and attribution research could inform policy approaches in accordance with justice considerations. We reveal a procedural injustice based on the imbalance of observations and knowledge of impacts between developed and developing countries. This type of injustice needs to be considered in policy negotiations and decisions, and efforts strengthened to reduce it."

      "Democracy for the Future: A Conceptual Framework to Assess Institutional Reform"
    ],
    "description": [
      "There seem to be good reasons that democratic institutions must be reformed in order to minimize the danger of unsustainable policy decisions infringing upon duties of intergenerational justice. This is why there exist a number of different proposals of how to reform democratic states in order to foster their duties towards the future. However, the debate lacks a systematic assessment of these suggested reforms within a coherent theoretical and norma-tive framework. This paper aims at developing such a framework.\r\nWe suggest two conceptual dimensions defining the spectrum of different justi-fiable institutional reforms: the relation between democracy and justice as one dimension and the conditions considered relevant for viewing democracies as responsible collective agents as the other. Depending on how we understand this relation and these conditions, it is possible to substantiate a set of types of institutional reforms that will promote democracies\u2019 capacities to comply with their responsibilities towards the future."

    "description": [
      "INTRODUCTION: Resistances to antimicrobials pose serious public health challenges. This issue concerns both human and veterinary medicine and can only be solved by a multidisciplinary approach. A comprehensive concept is, therefore, being worked out within the StAR (strategy antibiotic resistance) program in order to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for humans as well as animals. In this context, the AntibioticScout (www.AntibioticScout. ch) offers a new online tool for the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. By involving all stakeholders, the guidelines included in the AntibioticScout will result in a nationwide accepted standard for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals. An additional system for the rapid reporting of cases of suspected lack of efficacy of antimicrobials is integrated to allow early detection of emerging resistance and the immediate launch of risk mitigation measures. A first version of the AntibioticScout for the treatment of dogs, cats and horses is available by the end of 2016. All stakeholders are now invited to contribute to the development of the AntibioticScout decision support."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present research is first to investigate the unique effect of a humorous clown intervention on patients\u2019 emotional state in comparison with a different kind of intervention in a hospital setting using a controlled experimental method. Forty-four adult patients of a physical rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to either participate or observe 2 interventions: a hospital clown and a nurse intervention. Compared with baseline and the nurse intervention, the clown intervention elicited a higher level of amusement in patients. Both interventions elicited arousal, and neither intervention led to a change in negative emotions. No difference was found between the emotional states of participants and observers of the interventions at any level. A combination of general funniness of clown performances and felt transcendence during the hospital clown intervention best predicted the total amount of positive affect experienced during the intervention, which supports and extends results from previous studies. The results clearly support the benefit of hospital clown interventions for the elicitation of a positive emotional state in patients. Clowns working in hospitals should be encouraged to continue their work with patients in need of care."

      "A role for TIC55 as a hydroxylase of phyllobilins, the products of chlorophyll breakdown during plant senescence"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Chlorophyll degradation is the most obvious hallmark of leaf senescence. Phyllobilins, linear tetrapyrroles that are derived from opening of the chlorin macrocycle by the Rieske-type oxygenase PHEOPHORBIDE a OXYGENASE (PAO), are the end products of chlorophyll degradation. Phyllobilins carry defined modifications at several peripheral positions within the tetrapyrrole backbone. While most of these modifications are species-specific, hydroxylation at the C3(2) position is commonly found in all species analyzed to date. We demonstrate that this hydroxylation occurs in senescent chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) chromoplasts, we establish that phyllobilin hydroxylation is catalyzed by a membrane-bound, molecular oxygen-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent activity. As these features resemble the requirements of PAO, we considered membrane-bound Rieske-type oxygenases as potential candidates. Analysis of mutants of the two Arabidopsis Rieske-type oxygenases (besides PAO) uncovered that phyllobilin hydroxylation depends on TRANSLOCON AT THE INNER CHLOROPLAST ENVELOPE55 (TIC55). Our work demonstrates a catalytic activity for TIC55, which in the past has been considered as a redox sensor of protein import into plastids. Given the wide evolutionary distribution of both PAO and TIC55, we consider that chlorophyll degradation likely coevolved with land plants."

    "description": [
      "People benefit from being perceived as trustworthy. Examples include sellers trying to attract buyers, or candidates in elections trying to attract voters. In a laboratory experiment using exchange games, in which the trustor can choose the trustee, we study whether trustees can signal their trustworthiness by giving to charity. Our results show that donors are indeed perceived as more trustworthy and they are selected significantly more often as interaction partners. As a consequence of this sorting pattern, relative payoffs to donors and non-donors differ substantially with and without partner choice. However, we do not find donors to be significantly more trustworthy than non-donors. Our findings suggest that publicly observable generosity, such as investments in corporate social responsibility or donations to charity during a political campaign, can induce perceptions of trustworthiness and trust."

      "Down-regulation of tomato PHYTOL KINASE strongly impairs tocopherol biosynthesis and affects prenyllipid metabolism in an organ-specific manner"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Tocopherol, a compound with vitamin E (VTE) activity, is a conserved constituent of the plastidial antioxidant network in photosynthetic organisms. The synthesis of tocopherol involves the condensation of an aromatic head group with an isoprenoid prenyl side chain. The latter, phytyl diphosphate, can be derived from chlorophyll phytol tail recycling, which depends on phytol kinase (VTE5) activity. How plants co-ordinate isoprenoid precursor distribution for supplying biosynthesis of tocopherol and other prenyllipids in different organs is poorly understood. Here, Solanum lycopersicum plants impaired in the expression of two VTE5-like genes identified by phylogenetic analyses, named SlVTE5 and SlFOLK, were characterized. Our data show that while SlFOLK does not affect tocopherol content, the production of this metabolite is >80% dependent on SlVTE5 in tomato, in both leaves and fruits. VTE5 deficiency greatly impacted lipid metabolism, including prenylquinones, carotenoids, and fatty acid phytyl esters. However, the prenyllipid profile greatly differed between source and sink organs, revealing organ-specific metabolic adjustments in tomato. Additionally, VTE5-deficient plants displayed starch accumulation and lower CO2 assimilation in leaves associated with mild yield penalty. Taken together, our results provide valuable insights into the distinct regulation of isoprenoid metabolism in leaves and fruits and also expose the interaction between lipid and carbon metabolism, which results in carbohydrate export blockage in the VTE5-deficient plants, affecting tomato fruit quality."

      "Arabidopsis NAC016 promotes chlorophyll breakdown by directly upregulating STAYGREEN1 transcription"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The Arabidopsis transcriptional factor NAC016 directly activates chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence by binding to the promoter of SGR1 and upregulating its transcription. During leaf senescence or abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana, STAYGREEN1 (SGR1) promotes chlorophyll (Chl) degradation, acting with Chl catabolic enzymes, but the mechanism regulating SGR1 transcription remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis senescence-associated NAC transcription factor NAC016 directly activates SGR1 transcription. Under senescence-promoting conditions, the expression of SGR1 was downregulated in nac016-1 mutants and upregulated in NAC016-overexpressing (NAC016-OX) plants. By yeast one-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that NAC016 directly binds to the SGR1 promoter, which contains the NAC016-specific binding motif (termed the NAC016BM). Furthermore, nac016-1 SGR1-OX plants showed an early leaf yellowing phenotype, similar to SGR1-OX plants, confirming that NAC016 directly activates SGR1 expression in the leaf senescence regulatory cascade. Although we found that NAC016 activates SGR1 expression in senescing leaves, this transcriptional regulation is considerably weaker in maturing seeds; the seeds of sgr1-1 mutants (also known as nonyellowing1-1, nye1-1) stayed green, while the seeds of nac016-1 mutants turned from green to yellow normally. We also found that the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling-related transcription factor genes ABI5 and EEL and the ABA biosynthesis gene AAO3, which activate SGR1 expression directly or indirectly, were significantly downregulated in nac016-1 mutants and upregulated in NAC016-OX plants. However, the NAC016BM does not exist in their promoter regions, indicating that NAC016 may indirectly activate these ABA signaling and biosynthesis genes, probably by directly activating transcriptional cascades regulated by the NAC transcription factor NAP. The NAC016-mediated regulatory cascades of SGR1 and other Chl degradation-related genes are discussed."

    "description": [
      "The Paris Agreement has defined two kinds of market mechanisms for mitigation of climate change. The Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM) is modelled on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol \u2013 with a body of centralized rules overseen by a body on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Cooperative Approaches (CAs) might allow countries to define their proper set of rules, as long as environmental integrity and transparency are respected. The key question is now which of these mechanisms will be more attractive to governments and whether competition between the mechanisms leads to a vicious or virtuous circle \u2013 markets fragmenting or being integrated with climate finance.\r\nThe history of the market mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol has shown that lack of international rules can undermine environmental integrity, as under \u201eTrack 1\u201c of Joint Implementation. Safeguards need to prevent this in the case of the CAs. Given that the Paris Agreement is based on a bottom-up set of highly diverse national mitigation contributions, the Paris Mechanisms need to ensure that loose contributions are not leading to the generation of \u201ehot air\u201c reducing overall mitigation ambition. Moreover, double claiming of emissions units has to be prevented."

      "Function of the Golgi-located phosphate transporter PHT4;6 is critical for senescence-associated processes in Arabidopsis"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The phosphate transporter PHT4;6 locates to the trans-Golgi compartment, and its impaired activity causes altered intracellular phosphate compartmentation, leading to low cytosolic Pi levels, a blockage of Golgi-related processes such as protein glycosylation and hemicellulose biosynthesis, and a dwarf phenotype. However, it was unclear whether altered Pi homeostasis in pht4;6 mutants causes further cellular problems, typically associated with limited phosphate availability. Here we report that pht4;6 mutants exhibit a markedly increased disposition to induce dark-induced senescence. In control experiments, in which pht4;6 mutants and wild-type plants developed similarly, we confirmed that accelerated dark-induced senescence in mutants is not a 'pleiotropic' process associated with the dwarf phenotype. In fact, accelerated dark-induced senescence in pht4;6 mutants correlates strongly with increased levels of toxic NH4 (+) and higher sensitivity to ammonium, which probably contribute to the inability of pht4;6 mutants to recover from dark treatment. Experiments with modified levels of either salicylic acid (SA) or trans-zeatin (tZ) demonstrate that altered concentrations of these compounds in pht4;6 plants act as major cellular mediators for dark-induced senescence. This conclusion gained further support from the notion that the expression of the pht4;6 gene is, in contrast to genes coding for major phosphate importers, substantially induced by tZ. Taken together, our findings point to a critical function of PHT4;6 to control cellular phosphate levels, in particular the cytosolic Pi availability, required to energize plant primary metabolism for proper plant development. Phosphate and its allocation mediated by PHT4;6 is critical to prevent onset of dark-induced senescence."

      "The importance of strigolactone transport regulation for symbiotic signaling and shoot branching"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This review presents the role of strigolactone transport in regulating plant root and shoot architecture, plant-fungal symbiosis and the crosstalk with several phytohormone pathways. The authors, based on their data and recently published results, suggest that long-distance, as well local strigolactone transport might occur in a cell-to-cell manner rather than via the xylem stream. Strigolactones (SLs) are recently characterized carotenoid-derived phytohormones. They play multiple roles in plant architecture and, once exuded from roots to soil, in plant-rhizosphere interactions. Above ground SLs regulate plant developmental processes, such as lateral bud outgrowth, internode elongation and stem secondary growth. Below ground, SLs are involved in lateral root initiation, main root elongation and the establishment of the plant-fungal symbiosis known as mycorrhiza. Much has been discovered on players and patterns of SL biosynthesis and signaling and shown to be largely conserved among different plant species, however little is known about SL distribution in plants and its transport from the root to the soil. At present, the only characterized SL transporters are the ABCG protein PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 1 from Petunia axillaris (PDR1) and, in less detail, its close homologue from Nicotiana tabacum PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 6 (PDR6). PDR1 is a plasma membrane-localized SL cellular exporter, expressed in root cortex and shoot axils. Its expression level is regulated by its own substrate, but also by the phytohormone auxin, soil nutrient conditions (mainly phosphate availability) and mycorrhization levels. Hence, PDR1 integrates information from nutrient availability and hormonal signaling, thus synchronizing plant growth with nutrient uptake. In this review we discuss the effects of PDR1 de-regulation on plant development and mycorrhization, the possible cross-talk between SLs and other phytohormone transporters and finally the need for SL transporters in different plant species."

      "Enhanced photosynthesis and growth in atquac1 knockout mutants are due to altered organic acid accumulation and an increase in both stomatal and mesophyll conductance"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Stomata control the exchange of CO2 and water vapor in land plants. Thus, whereas a constant supply of CO2 is required to maintain adequate rates of photosynthesis, the accompanying water losses must be tightly regulated to prevent dehydration and undesired metabolic changes. Accordingly, the uptake or release of ions and metabolites from guard cells is necessary to achieve normal stomatal function. The AtQUAC1, an R-type anion channel responsible for the release of malate from guard cells, is essential for efficient stomatal closure. Here, we demonstrate that mutant plants lacking AtQUAC1 accumulated higher levels of malate and fumarate. These mutant plants not only display slower stomatal closure in response to increased CO2 concentration and dark but are also characterized by improved mesophyll conductance. These responses were accompanied by increases in both photosynthesis and respiration rates, without affecting the activity of photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes and the expression of other transporter genes in guard cells, which ultimately led to improved growth. Collectively, our results highlight that the transport of organic acids plays a key role in plant cell metabolism and demonstrate that AtQUAC1 reduce diffusive limitations to photosynthesis, which, at least partially, explain the observed increments in growth under well-watered conditions."

The method used relies on empirical distribution functions, which define a dynamic drift expressed in a stepwise joint probability surface. We create random discrete time-step trajectories that connect spatiotemporal points while maintaining a predefined geometry, often based on real observed trajectories. The resulting trajectories have multiple uses, such as to generate null models for hypotheses testing, to serve as a basis for resource selection models, through the integration of spatial context and to quantify space use intensity."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are a centrepiece of the new global climate regime which was agreed at COP21 in Paris and form the foundation for the pathway towards a low-carbon and climate resilient development. \r\nBy March 2016, 188 countries have submitted their INDCs, many of them including an unconditional as well as a conditional component. While those submitted INDCs are a significant step towards avoiding dangerous climate change, they are insufficient to reach the objective of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C or even 1.5\u00b0C as set out in the PA under Article 2.1(a). This implies two main challenges for the international community: (i) to assure that all INDCs will become NDCs and that not only unconditional but also all conditional components will be implemented in order to ensure that the emissions gap will not grow wider, and (ii) that additional ambition needs to be triggered and implemented so that this gap will be closed. Ensuring financing is available for the implementation of NDCs plays a crucial role for addressing both challenges.\r\nThis paper analyses specifically the financial aspects included in the INDCs and aims to contribute towards a definition of comprehensive financing strategies for implementing NDCs. It provides an analytical overview of the financial aspects that have been included in the INDCs submitted so far and provides a discussion of options for financing NDC implementation."

      "An indirect approach to map ethnic identities in post-conflict societies"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Ethnicity remains one of the most salient layers of individuals' social identities, and information about the distribution of ethnic identities turns out to be crucial for many studies that investigate political or social processes in divided societies. In the aftermath of civil wars, however, censuses providing such data are controversial and often delayed. Where census data are lacking, researchers can make use of the multiplier method to infer the distribution of ethnic identities based on indirect observations from sub-samples of the population. However, due to the selective nature of their data, the sub-samples might not be representative of the population. This paper proposes a method, which corrects for such selection effects. Based on the ethnic identity of birth-giving parents, the authors estimate the distribution of ethnic identities in the municipalities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2008\u20132010. They correct for possible selection biases by including economic, demographic and war-related variables. Multiple tests of validity show that this estimation appears to be the most accurate procedure currently available for the distribution of ethnic identities in municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

    "description": [
      "The contribution of this research note is a systematic description of levels of party nationalisation in Switzerland, using results from the elections to the Swiss National Council between 1991 and 2015. Party nationalisation is understood as the territorial homogeneity of a party's electoral performance and measured using the inverted and standardised Gini index. Our results indicate a trend towards more nationalisation in the Swiss party system over the time period covered, and distinct patterns for single parties. The SVP and the GLP have made big leaps towards stronger nationalisation, with the former closing in on the levels of the SP and the FDP, while the CVP remains a weakly nationalised party, considering its size."

    "description": [
      "The 2015 election to the Swiss Parliament marks a return to an already observed trend that was only interrupted in 2011: a shift to the right and an increase in polarization. The vote share of the nationalist-conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP) has now reached a historical height of 29.4% (+2.8). This note discusses why cantons matter in the Swiss national elections, and to what degree elections have become nationalized. Institutionally, the 26 cantons serve as electoral districts. This leads to a highly disproportional electoral system and has magnified the minor vote shifts to a slightly more pronounced shift in seats, with the right now holding a tiny majority of 101 of 200 seats in the first chamber. The two winners, the SVP and the Liberals, also had most campaign funds at their disposal. They were able to guide an extensive nationwide campaign in which they advocated their core issues instead of candidates. Other parties only advertised at the cantonal level."

    "description": [
      "This comparative study looks at how media reputation of multinational corporations (MNCs) is shaped by national societal contexts. Swiss and US MNCs from the banking and pharmaceutical industry were analyzed. As main predictors media system (Swiss vs. US) and the country of origin of the MNCs (home vs. abroad) were defined. Results show that the overall media reputation of MNCs is predominantly negative in Swiss and US media. However, reputation in US media is significantly more negative than in Swiss media. Independent of the media system reputation of MNCs in home media is more favorable than in abroad media."

      "Crisis communication research has hitherto attached too little importance to the way in which media organizations and journalists operate. The media are generally considered to play a key role in mediating information in crisis situations and the importance of framing effects in media reporting has been highlighted. However, most of the relevant studies are highly descriptive and provide little in the way of explanation. There is a particular lack of transnational studies that explain to what extent media reporting on organizational crises differs in various countries and media systems. If we are to learn more about transnational communications dynamics in connection with organizational crises, theoretical elements from disciplines which analyze the function logic of the media must be incorporated more strongly."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Species-specific gamete recognition is a key premise to ensure reproductive success and the maintenance of species boundaries. During plant pollen tube (PT) reception, gametophyte interactions likely allow the species-specific recognition of signals from the PT (male gametophyte) by the embryo sac (female gametophyte), resulting in PT rupture, sperm release, and double fertilization. This process is impaired in interspecific crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and related species, leading to PT overgrowth and a failure to deliver the sperm cells. Here we show that ARTUMES (ARU) specifically regulates the recognition of interspecific PTs in A. thaliana. ARU, identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), exclusively influences interspecific--but not intraspecific--gametophyte interactions. ARU encodes the OST3/6 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex conferring protein N-glycosylation. Our results suggest that glycosylation patterns of cell surface proteins may represent an important mechanism of gametophyte recognition and thus speciation."

    "description": [
      "This article examines whether money talks in political campaign coverage. Analyzing news coverage about twenty-nine recent direct-democratic campaigns in Switzerland, it shows that votes involving expensive campaigns and populist proposals\u2014and ideally both\u2014correlate with high media attention. This favors especially Switzerland's largest party with the most resources, the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party (SVP). A case study of one vote on media policy confirms these patterns and shows that news coverage is also shaped by the vested (self-)interests of media organizations. The results imply that news media, affected by the crisis in journalism, fail to cover a truly wide diversity of actors and topics."

    ],
    "description": [
      "AIM: To examine the associations between mental disorders and infectious, atopic, inflammatory diseases while adjusting for other risk factors.\r\nMEThODS: We used data from PsyCoLaus, a large Swiss Population Cohort Study (n = 3720; age range 35-66). Lifetime diagnoses of mental disorders were grouped into the following categories: Neurodevelopmental, anxiety (early and late onset), mood and substance disorders. They were regressed on infectious, atopic and other inflammatory diseases adjusting for sex, educational level, familial aggregation, childhood adversities and traumatic experiences in childhood. A multivariate logistic regression was applied to each group of disorders. In a complementary analysis interactions with sex were introduced via nested effects.\r\nRESULTS: Associations with infectious, atopic and other chronic inflammatory diseases were observable together with consistent effects of childhood adversities and familial aggregation, and less consistent effects of trauma in each group of mental disorders. Streptococcal infections were associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (men), and measles/mumps/rubella-infections with early and late anxiety disorders (women). Gastric inflammatory diseases took effect in mood disorders (both sexes) and in early disorders (men). Similarly, irritable bowel syndrome was prominent in a sex-specific way in mood disorders in women, and, moreover, was associated with early and late anxiety disorders. Atopic diseases were associated with late anxiety disorders. Acne (associations with mood disorders in men) and psoriasis (associations with early anxiety disorders in men and mood disorders in women) contributed sex-specific results. Urinary tract infections were associated with mood disorders and, in addition, in a sex-specific way with late anxiety disorders (men), and neurodevelopmental and early anxiety disorders (women).\r\nCONCLUSION: Infectious, atopic and inflammatory diseases are important risk factors for all groups of mental disorders. The sexual dimorphism of the associations is pronounced."

    "description": [
      "This study presents a data set of daily, 1\u202fkm resolution Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB) covering the period 1958\u20132015. Applying corrections for elevation, bare ice albedo and accumulation bias, the high-resolution product is statistically downscaled from the native daily output of the polar regional climate model RACMO2.3 at 11\u202fkm. The data set includes all individual SMB components projected to a down-sampled version of the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) digital elevation model and ice mask. The 1\u202fkm mask better resolves narrow ablation zones, valley glaciers, fjords and disconnected ice caps. Relative to the 11\u202fkm product, the more detailed representation of isolated glaciated areas leads to increased precipitation over the southeastern GrIS. In addition, the downscaled product shows a significant increase in runoff owing to better resolved low-lying marginal glaciated regions. The combined corrections for elevation and bare ice albedo markedly improve model agreement with a newly compiled data set of ablation measurements."

    ],
    "description": [
      "INTRODUCTION: A large number of studies have investigated neural correlates of consciousness in adults. However, knowledge about brain function in children with disorders of consciousness (DOC) is very limited. We suggest that EEG recordings during sleep are a promising approach. In healthy adults as well as in children, it has been shown that the activity of sleep slow waves (EEG spectral power 1-4.5\u00a0Hz), the primary characteristic of deep sleep, is dependent on use during previous wakefulness. Thus the regulation of slow wave activity (SWA) provides indirect insights into brain function during wakefulness.\r\nMETHODS: In the present study, we investigated high-density EEG recordings during sleep in ten healthy children and in ten children with acquired brain injury, including five children with DOC and five children with acquired brain injury without DOC. We used the build-up of SWA to quantify SWA regulation.\r\nRESULTS: Children with DOC showed a global reduction in the SWA build-up when compared to both, healthy children and children with acquired brain injury without DOC. This reduction was most pronounced over parietal brain areas. Comparisons within the group of children with DOC revealed that the parietal SWA build-up was the lowest in patients showing poor outcome. Longitudinal measurements during the recovery period showed an increase in parietal SWA build-up from the first to the second sleep recording.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the reduced parietal SWA regulation may represent a characteristic topographical marker for brain network dysfunction in children with DOC. In the future, the regulation of SWA might be used as a complementary assessment in adult and paediatric patients with DOC."

    "description": [
      "This paper examines the effect of CSR on the media reputation of corporations in crisis periods. As research object the media coverage of the Swiss banking industry before and after the financial crisis 2008 was selected. The method applied was a content analysis of Swiss newspapers between 2004 to 2010. The data shows that the financial crisis 2008 \u2013 as one of the major market disruptions in the recent past \u2013 fundamentally changed the public perception of CSR in the Swiss banking industry until today. Firstly, CSR got more important in the media coverage of the banks during the crisis and secondly had a negative effect on media reputation. This research therefore strengthens the notion of the relationship of CSR and reputation as a paradox or moral trap."

      "The monophyletic group of hornworts is believed to represent the immediate sister group of all vascular land plants. However, this traditional view is still debated and cannot be satisfactorily resolved owing to the lack of detailed knowledge on the general biology and genomic features of hornworts. Until now, advancement in this field was primarily hindered by the lack of genomic resources for a hornwort model species. Here we provide the first insight into the major features of the draft genome sequence of the model hornwort, Anthoceros agrestis. We show that A. agrestis has a remarkably small genome, with few recent paralogues, which makes it appropriate for genetic analysis. Finally, we also report on the genomic features of the chloroplast, mitochondrion and nuclear genomes and compare those with algal and vascular land plant genomes. At the very end of the chapter we summarize our achievements and provide a list of issues that need to be resolved in the future."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The present study examines the colonization history and phylogeography of the brush-warblers (Nesillas), a genus of passerines endemic to islands of the western Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Comoros, and Aldabra Atoll). The phylogeny of all recognized Nesillas taxa was reconstructed employing Bayesian phylogenetic methods and divergence times were estimated using a range of substitution rates and clock assumptions. Spatiotemporal patterns of population expansion were inferred and niches of different lineages were compared using ecological niche modelling. Our results indicate that taxa endemic to the Comoros are paraphyletic and that the two endemic species on Madagascar (Nesillas typica and Nesillas lantzii) are not sister taxa. The brush-warblers started to diversify approximately 1.6 Mya, commencing with the separation of the clade formed by two species endemic to the Comoros (Nesillas brevicaudata and Nesillas mariae) from the rest of the genus. The lineages leading to the two Malagasy species diverged approximately 0.9 Mya; each with significantly different modern ecological niches and the subject of separate demographic processes. Patterns of diversification and endemism in Nesillas were shaped by multiple long distance dispersal events and inter-island colonization, a recurring pattern for different lineages on western Indian Ocean islands. The diversification dynamics observed for Nesillas are also consistent with the taxon cycle hypothesis."

      "The 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup was characterized by massive public protests in hundreds of Brazilian cities. Such were the scale and intensity of the social unrest that the successful realization of the tournament was threatened. Violent police reactions to demonstrations exposed their lack of preparation and training, as well as the pervasive modes of conflict resolution in Brazil. While the protests themselves called into question the channelling of public resources into state of the art sports facilities, tax exemptions for FIFA and their corporate partners, and the lack of decent public services in Brazilian cities, protest-space was also contested territory. Black blocs, anarchists, right-wing anti-government organizations, and undercover police mixed with lower- and middle-class protesters, student groups, syndicalists, political parties, and newly formed civil society organizations. All of these groups were often present at the same protests, creating a melange of messages, tactics, and interpretations of dissent."

      "News about newspaper advertisers: To what extent can corporate advertising budgets predict editorial uptake and coverage of corporate press releases?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "News value theory aims to predict a story\u2019s chance of being selected for publication based on news factors and ascribed news values. News values can also predict the coverage of corporate press releases. For news decisions, a newspaper\u2019s revenue model may force editors to consider whether the source of a press release is an advertising client, despite the \u2018separation of church and state\u2019. In addition, for business journalism, corporate press releases have become an increasingly important news source. This study combines news values and advertiser weight to predict news coverage of press releases of banks in the news of partly and fully advertising-funded newspapers in Switzerland. Results show that advertiser importance can explain press release coverage concerning article length and tone in few cases, but has no universal news value. Public relations material is also not used as editorial subsidy for news. Larger companies are more successful in terms of press release uptake. However, their articles consist of a greater share of non-public relations material. Thus, our findings confirm editorial independence instead of copy-paste or obsequious journalism."

    ],
    "description": [
      "A new method is presented for the combination of spectro-electrochemistry and femtosecond 2D IR spectroscopy. The key concept is based on ultrathin (similar to nm) conductive layers of noble metals and indium-tin oxide (ITO) as working electrodes on a single-reflection attenuated total reflectance (ATR) element in conjunction with ultrafast, multidimensional ATR spectroscopy. The ATR geometry offers prominent benefits in ultrafast spectro-electrochemistry, that is, surface sensitivity for studying electrochemical processes directly at the solvent-electrode interface as well as the application of strongly IR-absorbing solvents such as water due to a very short effective path length of the evanescent wave at the interface. We present a balanced comparison between usable electrode materials regarding their performance in the ultrafast ATR setup. The electrochemical performance is demonstrated by vibrational Stark-shift spectroscopy of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed to platinum-coated, ultrathin ITO electrodes. We furthermore measure vibrational relaxation and spectral diffusion of the stretching mode from surface-bound CO dependent on the applied potential to the working electrode and find a negligible impact of the electrode potential on ultrafast CO dynamics."

    ],
    "description": [
      "We investigate surface enhancement in two-dimensional attenuated total reflectance infrared (2D ATR IR) spectroscopy from organic monolayers (MLs) at metal-liquid interfaces. We consider MLs from both aromatic and aliphatic organic samples equipped with nitrile and azide functional groups, both of which are widely used as local vibrational probes in ultrafast spectroscopy. Polarization-dependent 2D ATR IR spectroscopy indicates the excitation of local hot spots formed between gold (Au) nanoparticles as the dominant origin of signal enhancement. The highest enhancement factors (similar to 50) are observed in the case of aromatic nitrile MLs, whereas modest values (<10) are found for aliphatic azide and nitrile groups. Different contributions to signal enhancement are evaluated systematically and indicate the presence of both electromagnetic enhancement and contributions from molecular properties. The obtained enhancement factors are promising to allow 2D ATR IR spectroscopy to become applicable as a versatile technique for the detection of ultrafast structural dynamics in even low-absorbing organic MLs at solid-liquid interfaces."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In a recent work (J. Phys. Chem. C 2016, 120, 3350-3359), we have introduced the concept of surface-enhanced, two-dimensional attenuated total reflectance (2D ATR IR) spectroscopy with modest enhancement factors (<50) using small plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles at solid-liquid interfaces. Here, we show that employment of almost continuous noble metal layers results in significantly stronger enhancement factors in 2D ATR IR signals (>450), which allows for multi-quantum IR excitation of adsorbed molecules, a process known as \"vibrational ladder-climbing'', even for weakly absorbing (epsilon < 200 M-1 cm(-1)) nitrile IR labels. We show that it is possible to deposit up to four quanta of vibrational energy in the respective functional group. Based on these results, optical near-fields of plasmonic nanostructures may pave the way for future investigations involving ultrafast dynamics of highly excited vibrational states or surface-sensitive coherent control experiments of ground-state reactions at solid-liquid interfaces."

      "On correlated change in personality"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Correlated change in personality is essential to understanding change and development. It refers to the question of whether and to what degree changes in personality are interrelated over time within and between individuals. Compared to the longstanding literature on personality development, relatively less research has focused on correlated change in personality. The main goal of this paper is thus to discuss the potential of this concept for the field of personality development. First, we define correlated change and propose a categorization framework with multiple dimensions. Second, we discuss several theoretical concepts of correlated change that help understand the patterns, causes, and mechanisms underlying correlated change in personality. Third, we briefly describe several statistical approaches to modeling correlated change. Fourth, we summarize previous research on correlated change in personality. We focus our research on (a) correlated change within the Big Five personality traits, and (b) between the Big Five personality traits and three domains of life. Finally, we conclude by discussing challenges and future directions of the concept for the field of personality development."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Treatment options are limited for patients infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) with advanced liver disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 and advanced liver disease.\r\nMETHODS: We did an open-label study at 34 sites in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Cohort A included patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B (CTP-B) or CTP-C cirrhosis who had not undergone liver transplantation. Cohort B included post-transplantation patients who had either no cirrhosis; CTP-A, CTP-B, or CTP-C cirrhosis; or fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Patients in each group were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive 12 or 24 weeks of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) once daily (combination tablet), plus ribavirin (600-1200 mg daily). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis and all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and did not undergo liver transplantation during treatment were included in the efficacy analyses. Estimates of SVR12 and relapse rates and their two-sided 90% CI (Clopper-Pearson method) were provided. This exploratory phase 2 study was not powered for formal comparisons among treatment groups; no statistical hypothesis testing was planned or conducted. The trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2013-002802-30) and ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02010255).\r\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 14, 2014, and Aug 19, 2014, 398 patients were screened. Of 333 patients who received treatment, 296 had genotype 1 HCV and 37 had genotype 4 HCV. In cohort A, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 20 (87%, 90% CI 70-96) of 23 CTP-B patients with 12 weeks of treatment; 22 (96%, 81-100) of 23 CTP-B patients with 24 weeks of treatment; 17 (85%, 66-96) of 20 CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and 18 (78%, 60-91) of 23 CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). In cohort B, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 42 (93%, 84-98) of 45 patients without cirrhosis (12 weeks treatment); 44 (100%, 93-100) of 44 patients without cirrhosis (24 weeks treatment); 30 (100%, 91-100) of 30 CTP-A patients (12 weeks treatment); 27 (96%, 84-100) of 28 CTP-A patients (24 weeks treatment); 19 (95%, 78-100) of 20 CTP-B patients (12 weeks treatment); 20 (100%, 86-100) of 20 CTP-B patients (24 weeks treatment); one (50%, 3-98) of two CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and four (80%, 34-99) of five CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). All five patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis achieved SVR12 (100%, 90% CI 55-100). Among all patients with genotype 4 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 14 (78%, 56-92) of 18 patients (12 weeks treatment) and 16 (94%, 75-100) of 17 patients (24 weeks treatment). Seven patients (2%) discontinued ledipasvir-sofosbuvir prematurely due to adverse events. 17 patients died, mainly from complications of hepatic decompensation.\r\nINTERPRETATION: Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir and ribavirin provided high rates of SVR12 for patients with advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis before or after liver transplantation.\r\nFUNDING: Gilead Sciences."

    "description": [
      "Empirical studies investigating political parallelism in news coverage mostly look at the frequency and evaluation of party actors, though political parallelism is not only tied to parties but also to broader political ideologies. By contrast, this study examines country differences in political parallelism focusing on the alignment of media\u2019s issue interpretations with political ideologies. Based on a content analysis of 7256 statements in 961 articles about the Euro crisis in German and Spanish online newspapers, issue frames were identified in a data-driven approach before examining how the argumentative structure of these frames referred to ideologies. Results show that ideology-guided framing is present in nearly half of all articles. But Spanish media more often used frames corresponding to their political alignment than their German counterparts indicating stronger political parallelism in the Mediterranean Model. Thus, the results support the revision of the Hallin/Mancini Model of media systems proposed by Br\u00fcggemann et al."

      "Combining human computing and machine learning to make sense of big (aerial) data for disaster response"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Aerial imagery captured via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is playing an increasingly important role in disaster response. Unlike satellite imagery, aerial imagery can be captured and processed within hours rather than days. In addition, the spatial resolution of aerial imagery is an order of magnitude higher than the imagery produced by the most sophisticated commercial satellites today. Both the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) have noted that aerial imagery will inevitably present a big data challenge. The purpose of this article is to get ahead of this future challenge by proposing a hybrid crowdsourcing and real-time machine learning solution to rapidly process large volumes of aerial data for disaster response in a time-sensitive manner. Crowdsourcing can be used to annotate features of interest in aerial images (such as damaged shelters and roads blocked by debris). These human-annotated features can then be used to train a supervised machine learning system to learn to recognize such features in new unseen images. In this article, we describe how this hybrid solution for image analysis can be implemented as a module (i.e., Aerial Clicker) to extend an existing platform called Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (AIDR), which has already been deployed to classify microblog messages during disasters using its Text Clicker module and in response to Cyclone Pam, a category 5 cyclone that devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. The hybrid solution we present can be applied to both aerial and satellite imagery and has applications beyond disaster response such as wildlife protection, human rights, and archeological exploration. As a proof of concept, we recently piloted this solution using very high-resolution aerial photographs of a wildlife reserve in Namibia to support rangers with their wildlife conservation efforts (SAVMAP project, http://lasig.epfl.ch/savmap). The results suggest that the platform we have developed to combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to make sense of large volumes of aerial images can be used for disaster response."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The growing availability of very high resolution (<;1 m/pixel) satellite and aerial images has opened up unprecedented opportunities to monitor and analyze the evolution of land-cover and land-use across the world. To do so, images of the same geographical areas acquired at different times and, potentially, with different sensors must be efficiently parsed to update maps and detect land-cover changes. However, a na\u03cave transfer of ground truth labels from one location in the source image to the corresponding location in the target image is generally not feasible, as these images are often only loosely registered (with up to \u00b1 50m of non-uniform errors). Furthermore, land-cover changes in an area over time must be taken into account for an accurate ground truth transfer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a mid-level sensor-invariant representation that encodes image regions in terms of the spatial distribution of their spectral neighbors. We incorporate this representation in a Markov Random Field to simultaneously account for nonlinear mis-registrations and enforce locality priors to find matches between multi-sensor images. We show how our approach can be used to assist in several multimodal land-cover update and change detection problems."

      "Change in streamflow response in unregulated catchments in Sweden over the last century"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A Fourier spectral analysis of daily discharge time series over the last century in 79 unregulated catchments in Sweden reveals a significant gradual steepening of the discharge power spectrum slope over time. Where historical meteorological observations are available (the 41 southernmost catchments), the results of our analyses indicate that local land use changes within the catchments have affected discharge power spectra to a greater extent than have changes in precipitation patterns. 1-D distributed routing analysis based on current and historical maps and scenario modeling in the T\u00f6rnestorp Catchment suggests that changes in stream network properties have led to increases in the hydraulic P\u00e9clet number ( math formula) and subsequent decreases in the discharge power spectrum over short periods. The analysis displays analytically how a change in stream network properties can result in changes in the power spectra, where the relative importance of the geomorphological and hydrodynamic dispersion effects determines the shape of the streamflow response. The lowering of the discharge power spectrum over short periods observed for many Swedish catchments is likely caused by increasing  math formula (a decrease in dispersion) over time, resulting in higher peak values, especially for rapid streamflow responses (i.e., over short periods), demonstrated empirically for the T\u00f6rnestorp case study. The finding that the discharge power spectrum can change significantly over time highlights the need for hydrological models to account for the effect of the nonstationarity of parameters that result from temporal change caused by land use change and/or climate change that is due to anthropogenic or natural causes."

      "Assessing the benefit of snow data assimilation for runoff modeling in Alpine catchments"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In Alpine catchments, snowmelt is often a major contribution to runoff. Therefore, modeling snow processes is important when concerned with flood or drought forecasting, reservoir operation and inland waterway management. In this study, we address the question of how sensitive hydrological models are to the representation of snow cover dynamics and whether the performance of a hydrological model can be enhanced by integrating data from a dedicated external snow monitoring system. As a framework for our tests we have used the hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning) in the version HBV-light, which has been applied in many hydrological studies and is also in use for operational purposes. While HBV originally follows a temperature-index approach with time-invariant calibrated degree-day factors to represent snowmelt, in this study the HBV model was modified to use snowmelt time series from an external and spatially distributed snow model as model input. The external snow model integrates three-dimensional sequential assimilation of snow monitoring data with a snowmelt model, which is also based on the temperature-index approach but uses a time-variant degree-day factor. The following three variations of this external snow model were applied: (a) the full model with assimilation of observational snow data from a dense monitoring network, (b) the same snow model but with data assimilation switched off and (c) a downgraded version of the same snow model representing snowmelt with a time-invariant degree-day factor. Model runs were conducted for 20 catchments at different elevations within Switzerland for 15 years. Our results show that at low and mid-elevations the performance of the runoff simulations did not vary considerably with the snow model version chosen. At higher elevations, however, best performance in terms of simulated runoff was obtained when using the snowmelt time series from the snow model, which utilized data assimilation. This was especially true for snow-rich years. These findings suggest that with increasing elevation and the correspondingly increased contribution of snowmelt to runoff, the accurate estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) and snowmelt rates has gained importance."

    ],
    "description": [
      "There is an urgent need for compact, fast, and power-efficient hardware implementations of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. Here we propose a power-efficient approach for real-time inference, in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are implemented through low-power analog circuits. Although analog implementations can be extremely compact, they have been largely supplanted by digital designs, partly because of device mismatch effects due to fabrication. We propose a framework that exploits the power of Deep Learning to compensate for this mismatch by incorporating the measured variations of the devices as constraints in the DNN training process. This eliminates the use of mismatch minimization strategies such as the use of very large transistors, and allows circuit complexity and power-consumption to be reduced to a minimum. Our results, based on large-scale simulations as well as a prototype VLSI chip implementation indicate at least a 3-fold improvement of processing efficiency over current digital implementations."

      "Conversion of Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks for Low-power Neuromorphic Hardware"
    ],
    "description": [
      "In recent years the field of neuromorphic low-power systems gained significant momentum, spurring brain-inspired hardware systems which operate on principles that are fundamentally different from standard digital computers and thereby consume orders of magnitude less power. However, their wider use is still hindered by the lack of algorithms that can harness the strengths of such architectures. While neuromorphic adaptations of representation learning algorithms are now emerging, the efficient processing of temporal sequences or variable length-inputs remains difficult, partly due to challenges in representing and configuring the dynamics of spiking neural networks. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used in machine learning to solve a variety of sequence learning tasks. In this work we present a train-and-constrain methodology that enables the mapping of machine learned (Elman) RNNs on a substrate of spiking neurons, while being compatible with the capabilities of current and near-future neuromorphic systems. This \"train-and-constrain\" method consists of first training RNNs using backpropagation through time, then discretizing the weights and finally converting them to spiking RNNs by matching the responses of artificial neurons with those of the spiking neurons. We demonstrate our approach by mapping a natural language processing task (question classification), where we demonstrate the entire mapping process of the recurrent layer of the network on IBM's Neurosynaptic System TrueNorth, a spike-based digital neuromorphic hardware architecture. TrueNorth imposes specific constraints on connectivity, neural and synaptic parameters. To satisfy these constraints, it was necessary to discretize the synaptic weights to 16 levels, discretize the neural activities to 16 levels, and to limit fan-in to 64 inputs. Surprisingly, we find that short synaptic delays are sufficient to implement the dynamic (temporal) aspect of the RNN in the question classification task. Furthermore we observed that the discretization of the neural activities is beneficial to our train-and-constrain approach. The hardware-constrained model achieved 74% accuracy in question classification while using less than 0.025% of the cores on one TrueNorth chip, resulting in an estimated power consumption of approx. 17uW."

      "A Sure House: Studies on the Dynastic Promise to David in the Books of Samuel and Kings"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This book is a study of the texts referring or alluding to the dynastic promise to David in the books of Samuel and Kings (and the \u201cLaw of the King\u201d in Deut 17,14-20). Attention is paid to the textual problems of some of the studied passages, especially 2 Sam 7 which has different meanings in the most important textual witnesses (MT, LXXB, LXXL, 1 Chr 17MT, 1 Chr 17LXX). Although the most ancient retrievable text of 2 Sam 7 is not to be identified with MT, this text form corresponds to the original basic meaning of the chapter. Special attention is given to the value of 1 Chr 17 for the reconstruction of the oldest text of 2 Sam 7. There are many \u201csynonymous\u201d differences between 2 Sam 7 and 1 Chr 17, which cannot be explained as resulting from \u201cmistakes\u201d or \u201ctendentious\u201d (e.g. ideologically motivated) changes in one of the two traditions. A statistic study of the patterns of agreements among the witnesses leads to the conclusion that evaluating these differences \u201ccase by case\u201d would lead to arbitrary decisions; the great majority of these differences are a result of the Chronicler\u2019s relatively free approach to his source.\r\nThe emergence of 2 Sam 7,1-17 may be construed in two historical contexts. In the \u201cexilic\u201d period, the purpose of the dynastic promise being linked to the polemic against the traditional significance of the temple in royal ideology might be to preserve \u2013 or to establish \u2013 the validity of the promise after the fall of the temple. Alternatively, 2 Sam 7,1-17 might have been written at the time after Zerubbabel (at the end of the 6th / beginning of the 5th c.?), during the period when the temple of Jerusalem was restored, but the Davidides could not derive their legitimacy from it, since the cult and the temple were understood as the domain of priests under the auspices of Persian rule.\r\nThe author of 2 Sam 7,1-17 may also be thought to be responsible for 1 Sam 10,8 + 13,7b-15a and 1 Sam 25, the texts that primarily emphasize, in accordance with 2 Sam 7,14-15, the unconditional nature of the dynastic promise once it is given. In the books of Kings, 1 Kgs 2,24.33.45; 1 Kgs 11,29-38*; 15,4; 2 Kgs 8,19 could be ascribed to this hand as well. All these texts could have been written in both the Neo-Babylonian and Persian period, similarly to 2 Sam 7,1-17. However, some other references to the dynastic promise in Samuel (1 Sam 2,27-36; 2 Sam 7,18-29; 22,51; 23,1-7) cannot be dated to the Neo-Babylonian period (or even the very beginning of the Persian period). Theoretically, these texts could belong to the same redactional layer as 2 Sam 7,1-17, but only in case we adopt the later one of the two suggested dates of its origin. In contrast, if the earlier date is accepted for the first group of texts, the second group must have been added later (in one or several stages). At any rate, whereas all these texts may be regarded as a defense of actual political interests of the ex-royal family in the exilic and/or post-exilic period, this does not hold for 1 Kgs 2,4; 8,25; 9,4-5 where the power of the Davidic kings is explicitly conditional upon the eternal loyalty of David\u2019s descendants to Yhwh. These passages cannot be ascribed to the same author(s) as the other references to the dynastic promise in Samuel\u2013Kings; on the other hand, this redaction in Kings was perhaps not driven by actual anti-Davidic political interests, representing rather an attempt to explain the unfulfillment of the dynastic promise.\r\nFollowing W. Oswald (and building on the work of S. McKenzie), we ascribe the oracles against the founders of the dynasties (or, in the case of Ahab, the dynasty\u2019s other \u201cprominent\u201d member) ruling in northern Israel and the related fulfillment notices (1 Kgs 14,7-18; 15,27-30; 16,1-4.11-13; 21,20-24*; 2 Kgs 9,7-10*.25-26.36-37*; 10,1a.10-17) to the same author as 2 Sam 7,1-17 (the promise to Jehu in 2 Kgs 10,30 belongs here as well). Hence, both dynastic promises to and judgments against dynasties in Sam\u2013Kgs depend on the piety of the dynasty\u2019s founder. This conception of the history of the Judean and Israelite kingdoms as a history of royal dynasties, unfolding according to the evaluation of the dynasty\u2019s founder, is largely determined by the historical situation of the Davidides after the loss (or radical downfall) of their power in the 6th and 5th c. B.C.E. The author of these texts is the (first) author of the book of Kings, and probably also the first redactor of Samuel (though the latter might have existed in some form earlier). These books were composed on the basis of older sources in the Neo-Babylonian or, perhaps more likely, Persian period."

      "Promoting photochemical water oxidation with metallic band structures"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The development of economic water oxidation catalysts is a key step toward large-scale water splitting. However, their current exploration remains empirical to a large extent. Elucidating the correlations between electronic properties and catalytic activity is crucial for deriving general and straightforward catalyst design principles. Herein, strongly correlated electronic systems with abundant and easily tunable electronic properties, namely La1\u2013xSrxBO3 perovskites and La2-xSrxBO4 layered perovskites (B = Fe, Co, Ni, or Mn), were employed as model systems to identify favorable electronic structures for water oxidation. We established a direct correlation between the enhancement of catalytic activity and the insulator to metal transition through tuning the electronic properties of the target perovskite families via the La3+/Sr2+ ratio. Their improved photochemical water oxidation performance was clearly linked to the increasingly metallic character. These electronic structure\u2013activity relations provide a promising guideline for constructing efficient water oxidation catalysts."

      "Digital social norm enforcement: online firestorms in social media"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Actors of public interest today have to fear the adverse impact that stems from social media platforms. Any controversial behavior may promptly trigger temporal, but potentially devastating storms of emotional and aggressive outrage, so called online firestorms. Popular targets of online firestorms are companies, politicians, celebrities, media, academics and many more. This article introduces social norm theory to understand online aggression in a social-political online setting, challenging the popular assumption that online anonymity is one of the principle factors that promotes aggression. We underpin this social norm view by analyzing a major social media platform concerned with public affairs over a period of three years entailing 532,197 comments on 1,612 online petitions. Results show that in the context of online firestorms, non-anonymous individuals are more aggressive compared to anonymous individuals. This effect is reinforced if selective incentives are present and if aggressors are intrinsically motivated."

The complexes have been fully characterised and initial studies on their potential to function as molecular water oxidation catalysts have been performed. Both complexes catalyse the oxidation of water in acidic media with Ce$^{IV}$ as a stoichiometric chemical oxidant, although turnover numbers and turnover frequencies are modest when compared with the closely related Ru-bda and Ru-pda analogues. Barriers for the water nucleophilic attack and intermolecular coupling pathways were obtained from density functional theory calculations and the crucial influence of the ligand framework in determining the most favourable reaction pathway was elucidated from a combined analysis of the theoretical and experimental results."

      "Understanding current technological changes is the basis for better forecasting of technological changes. Because technology is path dependent, monitoring past and current trends of technological development helps managers and decision makers to identify probable future technologies in order to prevent organizational failure. This study suggests a method based on patent-development paths, k-core analysis and topic modeling of past and current trends of technological development to identify technologies that have the potential to become disruptive technologies. We find that within the photovoltaic industry, thin-film technology is likely to replace the dominant technology, namely crystalline silicon. In addition, we identity the hidden technologies, namely multi-junction, dye-sensitized and concentration technologies, that have the potential to become disruptive technologies within the three main technologies of the photovoltaic industry."

    "description": [
      "Antarctica Bedmap2 datasets are used to calculate subglacial hydraulic potential and the area, depth and volume of hydraulic potential sinks. There are over 32 000 contiguous sinks, which can be thought of as predicted lakes. Patterns of subglacial melt are modelled with a balanced ice flux flow model, and water fluxes are cumulated along predicted flow pathways to quantify steady-state fluxes from the main basin outlets and from known subglacial lakes. The total flux from the continent is ~21 km3 a\u22121. Byrd Glacier has the greatest basin flux of ~2.7 km3 a\u22121. Fluxes from subglacial lakes range from ~1 \u00d7 10\u22124 to ~1.5 km3 a\u22121. Lake turnover times are calculated from their volumes and fluxes, and have median values of ~100 a for known \u2018active\u2019 lakes and ~500 a for other lakes. Recurrence intervals of a 0.25 km3 flood range from ~2 months to ~2000 a (median \u2248130 a) for known \u2018active\u2019 lakes and from ~2 to ~2400 a (median \u2248 360 a) for other lakes. Thus, several lakes that have recently been observed to fill and drain may not do so again for many centuries; and several lakes that have not, so far, been observed to fill and drain have the potential to do so, even at annual to decadal timescales."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are complex software environments and we often work with multiple tasks and multiple displays when we work with GIS. However, user input is still limited to mouse and keyboard in most workplace settings. In this project, we demonstrate how the use of gaze and feet as additional input modalities can overcome time-consuming and annoying mode switches between frequently performed tasks. In an iterative design process, we developed gaze- and foot-based methods for zooming and panning of map visualizations. We first collected appropriate gestures in a preliminary user study with a small group of experts, and designed two interaction concepts based on their input. After the implementation, we evaluated the two concepts comparatively in another user study to identify strengths and shortcomings in both. We found that continuous foot input combined with implicit gaze input is promising for supportive tasks."

    ],
    "description": [
      "In this study, we first develop a hypothesis that existing quantitative visual complexity measures will overall reflect the level of cartographic generalization, and test this hypothesis. Specifically, to test our hypothesis, we first selected common geovisualization types (i.e., cartographic maps, hybrid maps, satellite images and shaded relief maps) and retrieved examples as provided by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and SchweizMobil by swisstopo. Selected geovisualizations vary in cartographic design choices, scene contents and different levels of generalization. Following this, we applied one of Rosenholtz et al.\u2019s (2007) visual clutter algorithms to obtain quantitative visual complexity scores for screenshots of the selected maps. We hypothesized that visual complexity should be constant across generalization levels, however, the algorithm suggested that the complexity of small-scale displays (less detailed) is higher than those of large-scale (high detail). We also observed vast differences in visual complexity among maps providers, which we attribute to their varying approaches towards the cartographic design and generalization process. Our efforts will contribute towards creating recommendations as to how the visual complexity algorithms could be optimized for cartographic products, and eventually be utilized as a part of the cartographic design process to assess the visual complexity."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The study of spatial presence is currently receiving increased attention in both media psychology and communication research. The present paper introduces the Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES), a short eight-item self-report measure. The SPES is derived from a process model of spatial presence (Wirth et al., 2007, Media Psychology, 9, 493\u2013525), and assesses spatial presence as a two-dimensional construct that comprises a user\u2019s self-location and perceived possible actions in a media environment. The SPES is shorter than many other available spatial presence scales, and can be conveniently applied to diverse media settings. Two studies are reported (N1 = 290, N2 = 395) that confirm sound psychometric qualities for the SPES."

      "Do city governments and administrations use interactive online tools in their communication? Are they eager to foster interaction with citizens via social networks and microblogs? And what kind of tools do they employ on their websites? We seek to answer these questions with a quantitative analysis of interactive political online communication implemented by city governments and administrations in Switzerland. Results show that more than 70% of all Swiss cities (N = 159) offer at least one interactive tool; about one third of the cities are active in social networks. In the French-speaking part of Switzerland more cities use social networks than in the German part, while the Italian-speaking part, Ticino, lags behind."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The gains from insurance arise from the transfer of income across states. Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid upfront, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate is 72%, compared to 5% for the standard upfront contract, and take-up is highest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes indicate that liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk are all important constraints on the demand for standard insurance. Finally, evidence from a natural experiment in the United States, exploiting a change in the timing of the premium payment for Federal Crop Insurance, sho  s that the transfer across time also affects insurance adoption in developed countries."

      "Game Mechanisms for Training Moral Sensitivity: A Research Design"
    ],
    "description": [
      "The competence of moral sensitivity is increasingly regarded as key for the morality of people's social and professional behavior. However, specialized training strategies have yet to be developed. Training moral sensitivity through video games seems to be a particularly promising approach. This paper presents a research design for a strategic evaluation of numerous game mechanisms concerning their ability to support the development of moral sensitivity. In the first step, the competence of moral sensitivity is broken down into more concrete sub-competences and learning outcomes, which shall be achieved. In the second step, a complementary framework for the strategic selection and implementation of suitable game mechanisms shall be designed. The present paper exemplarily introduces 15 training strategies, which effectively support the development of attitudes and values. Such validated strategies can aid the selection and design of relevant game mechanisms. Based on this framework, game mechanisms can be evaluated against their specific relevance for particular learning outcomes, and their general ability to realize relevant training strategies. Two game mechanisms are exemplarily evaluated in terms of their ability to foster the attitude of universalism, and their general ability to be used for the achievement of attitudinal learning outcomes. The overall framework shall enable a systematic evaluation of game mechanisms for the promotion of cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral learning outcomes linked to moral sensitivity. The framework will be transferable to the game-based training of other competences, though."

      "The citizens of Europe are facing increasingly complex challenges to their career development nowadays. Over the span of their lifetime, they need to manage their careers, and make numerous decisions concerning education, training and employment \u2013 decisions, which seriously impact their futures and their wellbeing. To prepare citizens for these challenges, and to support them in the progress, competent career practitioners are needed. But what kinds of career practitioners are we talking about? And what do they need to be able to do? How can the quality of their training be assured? \r\nThis handbook introduces common European competence standards for the academic training of career practitioners in Europe, together with some proposals and examples, of how to implement and establish such competence standards in practice. More than 200 experts from all across Europe have contributed to the development of these shared standards of the Network for Innovation in Career Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE). The standards are already being used in many countries for the development of degree programmes."

    "description": [
      "Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (GMO Panel) assessed the annual post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report for the 2014 growing season of maize MON 810 provided by Monsanto Europe S.A. The GMO Panel concludes that the insect resistance monitoring data do not indicate a decrease in susceptibility of field Iberian populations of corn borers to the Cry1Ab protein over the 2014 season. However, as the methodology for insect resistance monitoring remained unchanged compared to previous PMEM reports, the GMO Panel reiterates its previous recommendations for improvement of the insect resistance management plan. The GMO Panel considers that the farmer alert system to report complaints regarding product performance could complement the information obtained from the laboratory bioassays, but encourages the consent holder to provide more information in order to be in a position to appraise its usefulness. The data on general surveillance activities do not indicate any unanticipated adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from the cultivation of maize MON 810 cultivation in 2014. The GMO Panel reiterates its previous recommendations to improve the methodology for the analysis of farmer questionnaires and conduct of the literature review in future annual PMEM reports on maize MON 810. The GMO Panel urges the consent holder to consider how to make best use of the information recorded in national registers to optimise sampling for farmer questionnaires, and requests to continue reviewing and discussing relevant scientific publications on possible adverse effects of maize MON 810 on rove beetles. Also, the GMO Panel encourages relevant parties to continue developing a methodological framework to use existing networks in the broader context of environmental monitoring."

      "The Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (GMO Panel) previously assessed the two single events combined to produce soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2 and did not identify safety concerns. No new data on the single events affecting the original conclusions were identified. Based on the molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional characteristics, the combination of soybean events 305423 and 40-3-2 in the two-event stack soybean did not raise concerns regarding food and feed safety or nutrition. The combination of the newly expressed proteins in the two-event stack soybean did not raise human or animal health concerns. No compositional differences requiring further assessment were identified between soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2, the non-GM comparator, additional comparators and the non-GM commercial soybean reference varieties, except for the altered fatty acid profile (consistent with the intended trait). Nutritional assessment of food products from soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2 identified no concerns for human health and nutrition. There are no concerns regarding the use of feedingstuffs from defatted toasted soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2 meal. There are no indications of an increased likelihood of establishment and spread of occasional feral soybean plants, unless these are exposed to acetolactate-synthase-inhibiting or glyphosate-containing herbicides. Risks associated with the unlikely, but theoretically possible, horizontal transfer of recombinant genes from soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2 to bacteria were not identified. Considering the scope of the application, interactions with biotic and abiotic environments are not considered a relevant issue. The post-market environmental monitoring plan and reporting intervals are in line with the intended uses of soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2. The GMO Panel is of the opinion that soybean 305423 \u00d7 40-3-2 is as safe as the non-GM comparator and non-GM commercial soybean varieties with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and environment in the context of its scope. The GMO panel recommends a post-market monitoring plan."

      "In this opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel assesses the five-event stack maize and 20 of its subcombinations independently of their origin. The EFSA GMO Panel has previously assessed the five single events that are combined to produce this five-event stack maize Bt11 \u00d7 59122 \u00d7 MIR604 \u00d7 1507 \u00d7 GA21 and did not identify safety concerns. No new data on the single events, leading to a modification of the original conclusions on their safety, were identified. The molecular, agronomic, phenotypic and compositional data on the five-event stack maize did not give rise to safety concerns and there is no reason to expect interactions between the single events impacting on the food and feed safety of the five-event stack maize. Considering the scope of the application (no cultivation), routes of exposure and limited exposure levels, the Panel concludes that this five-event stack maize would not raise safety concerns in the event of accidental release of viable grains into the environment. The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that the five-event stack maize is as safe and as nutritious as its conventional counterpart in the context of its scope. For the 20 subcombinations, the EFSA GMO Panel followed a weight-of-evidence approach, and concluded that they are expected to be as safe as the five-event stack maize. No specific data were submitted for the subcombinations included in the scope of this application that could be produced by conventional crossing through targeted breeding approaches. In order to reduce the consequent uncertainties and to confirm assumptions made for their assessment, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that the applicant should provide relevant information, if these subcombinations were to be created via targeted breeding approaches and imported into the EU in the future. In this case, this information should focus on expression levels of the newly expressed proteins.\r\n\r\nA minority opinion expressed by an EFSA GMO Panel member is appended to this opinion."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) has previously assessed genetically modified (GM) maize DAS-59122-7 as a single event as well as part of several stacked events. These maize events were found to be as safe as their conventional counterparts and other appropriate comparators with respect to potential effects on human and animal health, and the environment. On 26 July 2016, the European Commission received from Pioneer new nucleic acid sequencing data on maize event DAS-59122-7 and updated bioinformatic analyses using the new sequencing data. The European Commission tasked EFSA to analyse these data and to indicate whether the previous conclusions of the GMO Panel on the previously assessed GM maize events remain valid. The GMO Panel used the appropriate principles described in its guidelines for the risk assessment of GM plants to analyse the received data. The new sequencing data indicated three base pair (bp) differences compared to the sequencing data originally provided; two located in a non-coding region of the insert and one located in the 5\u2032 genomic flanking region. These base pairs reported as differences in the new nucleic acid sequencing data on maize event DAS-59122-7 had already been present in the original plant material used for the risk assessment. Thus, with the exception of bioinformatics analyses, the studies performed for the risk assessment remain valid. The new sequencing data and the bioinformatic analyses performed on the new sequence did not give rise to safety issues. Therefore, the GMO Panel concludes that the original risk assessment of event DAS-59122-7 as a single and as a part of stacked events remains valid."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Background: Maternal iron deficiency and infection during pregnancy have individually been associated with increased\r\nrisk of schizophrenia in the offspring, but possible interactions between the two remain unidentified thus\r\nfar. Therefore, we determined the individual and combined effects of maternal infection during pregnancy and\r\nprepartum anemia on schizophrenia risk in the offspring.\r\nMethods: We conducted a population-based study with individual record linkage of the Danish Civil Registration\r\nSystem, the Danish Hospital Register, and the Central Danish Psychiatric Register. In a cohort of Danish singleton\r\nbirths 1,403,183 born between 1977 and 2002, 6729 developed schizophrenia between 1987 and 2012. Cohort\r\nmembers were considered as having a maternal history of anemia if the mother had received a diagnosis of anemia\r\nat any time during the pregnancy.Maternal infection was defined based on infections requiring hospital admission\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nResults: Maternal anemia and infection were both associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in unadjusted\r\nanalyses (1.45-fold increase for anemia, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.82; 1.32-fold increase for infection, 95% CI: 1.17\u20131.48).\r\nThe effect of maternal infection remained significant (1.16-fold increase, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.31) after adjustment\r\nfor possible confounding factors. Combined exposure to anemia and an infection increased the effect size to a\r\n2.49-fold increased schizophrenia risk (95% CI: 1.29\u20134.27). The interaction analysis, however, failed to provide\r\nevidence for multiplicative interactions between the two factors.\r\nConclusion: Our findings indicate thatmaternal anemia and infection have additive but not interactive effects, and\r\ntherefore, they may represent two independent risk factors of schizophrenia."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Maternal immune activation can increase the vulnerability of the offspring to develop neuroimmune and behavioral abnormalities in response to stress in puberty. In offspring of immune-challenged mothers, stress-induced inflammatory processes precede the adult onset of multiple behavioral dysfunctions. Here, we explored whether an early anti-inflammatory intervention during peripubertal stress exposure might prevent the subsequent emergence of adult behavioral pathology. We used an environmental two-hit model in mice, in which prenatal maternal administration of the viral mimetic poly(I:C) served as the first hit, and exposure to sub-chronic unpredictable stress during peripubertal maturation as the second hit. Using this model, we examined the effectiveness of the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline (MINO) given during stress exposure to block stress-induced inflammatory responses and to prevent subsequent behavioral abnormalities. We found that combined exposure to prenatal immune activation and peripubertal stress caused significant deficits in prepulse inhibition and increased sensitivity to the psychotomimetic drugs amphetamine and dizocilpine in adulthood. MINO treatment during stress exposure prevented the emergence of these behavioral\r\ndysfunctions. In addition, the pharmacological intervention blocked hippocampal and prefrontal microglia activation and\r\ninterleukin-1\u03b2 expression in offspring exposed to prenatal infection and peripubertal stress. Together, these findings demonstrate that presymptomatic MINO treatment can prevent the subsequent emergence of multiple behavioral abnormalities relevant to human neuropsychiatric disorders with onset in early adulthood, including schizophrenia. Our epidemiologically informed two-hit model may thus encourage attempts to explore the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the early course of brain disorders that are characterized by signs of central nervous system inflammation during development."

It is argued in this paper that the debate about autonomy is at its core a debate about the reasons for respecting decisions. Decisions of persons are to be respected as their decisions, and they have to be respected as determining the deontic properties of situations. This, however, can only be understood against the background of persons having rights over themselves. Their decisions determine the deontic properties as exercises of their rights. Thus, respect for the autonomous choice of persons turns out to be respect for their rights."

Consent, it will be argued, does not make acts permissible by excluding reasons speaking against them. Consent rather makes acts permissible by eliminating the wrong-making property of the acts.

In a first step, I distinguish between two fundamentally different ways of thinking about philosophical development, viz. externalism and internalism with regard to historical developments in philosophy, and I consider two ways of defining the two respective positions. Next, I specify certain methodological decisions that are relevant when writing a study on a particular philosophical development, and I characterize Udo Thiel\u2019s book with respect to them.

      "This paper discusses trust as a condition of the possibility of enlightenment. It claims that trust matters for the capacity to accept rather than to justify beliefs. This view is defended against the background of a functional approach to trust according to which it is by virtue of trust that people may enter into and sustain stable, potentially reflexive, and affirmative relations to all kinds of relata, not exclusively other people. All in all, a distinction between two theoretical layers is proposed: a transcendental-philosophical layer which examines whether trust is a condition of epistemic action, and a normative layer which discusses the problems of the justification of trust. This distinction, it is argued, is crucial to defending the ideal of enlightenment, or epistemic autonomy: before one can discuss problems of the justification of trust, trust is to be understood as a condition of the possibility of acting or, in epistemic contexts, of accepting beliefs"

    ],
    "description": [
      "Crowdfunding has emerged as an additional source for financing research in recent years. The study at hand identifies and tests explanatory factors influencing the success of scientific crowdfunding projects by drawing on news value theory, the \u201creputation signaling\u201d approach, and economic theories of online payment. A standardized content analysis of 371 projects on English- and German-language platforms reveals that each theory provides factors influencing crowdfunding success. It shows that projects presented on science-only crowdfunding platforms have a higher success rate. At the same time, projects are more likely to be successful if their presentation includes visualizations and humor, the lower their targeted funding is, the less personal data potential donors have to relinquish and the more interaction between researchers and donors is possible. This suggests that after donors decide to visit a scientific crowdfunding platform, factors unrelated to science matter more for subsequent funding decisions, raising questions about the potential and implications of crowdfunding science."

      "Political communication is crucial for opinion formation about any kind of political issue. According to arguments in the literature on the local public sphere and in political science, processes of communication and opinion formation differ at the local and national levels. However, opinion formation about national and local issues has yet to be compared systematically. This study analyses differences in the communication processes at the local and national levels in Germany based on a survey (n\u2009=\u20091014). The results demonstrate that opinions about local and national issues are predisposed, and hardly any media effects occur. Respondents\u2019 opinions about local issues are formed more systematically, and interpersonal discussions can be influential while opinions about national issues are based less on personal relevance. In sum, opinion formation processes differ at local and national levels but not always in the way it is often assumed in the existing literature."

    "description": [
      "This paper investigates how the unique financial model of multilateral development banks \u2013 dependent largely on issuing bonds in private capital markets to raise lending resources \u2013 came about in the early history of three different MDBs, and how this in turn shaped their operational characteristics. Historical research demonstrates that the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and Andean Development Corporation (CAF) converged on organisational and operational arrangements very different to what their founders had intended, and much closer to one another, as a direct result of the need to secure sufficient resources to function as viable development lenders. The findings indicate that in the absence of governments willing or able to provide significant financing out of their budgets, MDBs tend to converge towards a single organisational model in order to maintain access to international capital markets. All three MDBs examined here modified their lending and financial policies in unexpected ways and, in the case of the IADB and CAF, even restructured their original membership, specifically for the purpose of securing adequate financial resources."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Although ideological polarization can create problems for governability and democratic stability, I argue that it also has beneficial effects in new democracies. By clarifying the political alternatives, polarization creates strong links between parties and voters, and thereby instills mechanisms of accountability. These mechanisms force parties to remain responsive to evolving voter preferences. A comparative historical analysis of six South American cases demonstrates that the vast differences in the quality of representation in the 1980s, immediately after many countries in the region returned to democracy, were rooted in an early bifurcation of party systems in the first half of the twentieth century: While prolonged periods of ideological conflict occurred in some countries in this period, polarization was aborted by various means in others. By showing that ideological moderation may help formal democracies to survive, but that aborting conflict in the long run severely hampers key aspects of the quality of democracy, this article suggests a revision of conventional views regarding ideological polarization."

      "Carbonate and elemental accumulation rates in arid soils of mid-to-late Pleistocene outwash terraces, southeastern Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA"
    ],
    "description": [
      "An important result of the past few decades of soil\u2013geomorphic research is the awareness of the major role of dust and related carbonate precipitates in arid soils. The temporal evolution of soils developed on outwash terraces is still a matter of debate particularly regarding the type of evolution: progressive evolution and constant rates vs complex and/or interval-accumulation rates (progressive or regressive evolution possible). Soils on a chronosequence of outwash terraces just outside and downstream of canyon mouths of the Wind River Range (USA) were analysed for carbonate accumulation, organic carbon and poorly-crystalline pedogenetic oxyhydroxides stocks and pathways of chemical weathering. The soils and their carbonate stocks in the fine earth fraction (< 2 mm) can be used as a relative dating tool and appear to correlate with regional glacial chronostratigraphy [Pinedale (c. 20 ky), Bull Lake (with two different units around 160 and 260 ky) and Sacagawea Ridge (c. 660 ky)]. Carbonate stocks of soils on these terraces increase with increasing soil age, but at generally decreasing rates. A quasi-steady state situation, however, was not reached before 1 My. The time-split approach showed that CaCO3 accumulation rates were the highest during marine isotope (MIS) cold stages (2.13 g CaCO3/m2/y), presumably due to a sparse vegetation cover during MIS2 (Pinedale) and 8 (lower Bull lake). Compared to organic carbon (c. 8\u201310 kg Corg/m2), the inorganic carbon stocks of the fine earth fraction were much higher (c. 60 kg Cinorg/m2). Although the dominant pedogenic process here appears to be carbonate accumulation, chemical weathering and elemental leaching also are significant. Weathering data were obtained using immobile elements and rare earth elements (REE) as tracers. Chemical weathering and related leaching were particularly notable for Na originating from plagioclase. In addition, pedogenetic Al and Mn oxyhydroxides accumulate (220 and 32 g/m2, respectively, after 660 ky). These form at relatively low rates, however, when compared to moister and cooler conditions at higher altitudes in the Wind River Range. Due to the dry climate under which the terrace soils formed (annual precipitation 32 cm/yr\u2212 1), weakly crystalline and amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxide is rapidly transformed into crystalline forms (hematite) over time. Consequently, the stocks of weakly crystalline and amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxide was significantly lower in the ~ 660 ky soils (50 g/m2) than in the Holocene soils (1000 g/m2).\r\n\r\nThe development of soils on Quaternary outwash terraces in this region is controlled through the rates of aeolian influx over time as modified by glacial/interglacial climate variations rather than by moisture availability. Consequently, carbonate accumulation rates in these soils are \u2018influx limited\u2019 rather than \u2018moisture limited\u2019."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Referenda in Greece and the UK have recently sent shockwaves across Europe. This paper examines this popular challenge to international cooperation in a systematic fashion by focusing on foreign policy referenda in which a non-cooperative vote is associated with large negative externalities. Such high-stakes referenda are unusual because the consequences of a non-cooperative referendum outcome cannot be controlled by the national government but instead depend on whether the other countries accommodate or penalize the non-cooperative vote. This implies that voters\u2019 expectations about the likely reaction abroad will be highly influential for voting behavior. Foreign policymakers can influence these expectations by sending costly signals ahead of the vote, thus trying to sway the vote in favor of cooperation. Using original survey data from a recent high-stakes referendum, the 2015 Greek referendum, we show that expectations about the consequences of a non-cooperative vote had a powerful effect on voting behavior. Leveraging the bank closure in Greece, we also show that costly signals sent by the other member states made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a no-vote and increased the share of cooperative votes."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Despite years of crisis, the euro is still enjoying strong popular support in many of the Eurozone crisis countries. Given the high costs that the crisis has imposed on these countries, this raises the question why the public thinks so favorable of the union, and under which circumstances these high support levels may decrease. Using original survey data from three consecutive survey waves in Greece (from July, September and December 2015), we analyze why Greeks view the euro so favorably. We use a detailed battery of questions, designed specifically to tap the many explanations given in the literature and public debate for this phenomenon, to tease out the different mechanisms. Using survey experiments, we then specifically focus on the tradeoff between keeping the euro and austerity. We find that as individuals learn that austerity is the price for staying in the euro, their support for the common currency weakens, a trend that we can also observe over time, as support for the euro fell significantly between July and December 2015. Overall, our paper provides an explanation why political elites so far have been able to commit to painful austerity and reforms: they had a clear mandate to everything necessary to stay in the euro. Our results suggest, however, that this may change when the costs of austerity become too high, making an exit for the Eurozone a distinct possibility."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This paper examines the synthetic control method in contrast to commonly used difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation, in the context of a re-evaluation of a pay-for-performance (P4P) initiative, the Advancing Quality scheme. The synthetic control method aims to estimate treatment effects by constructing a weighted combination of control units, which represents what the treated group would have experienced in the absence of receiving the treatment. While DiD estimation assumes that the effects of unobserved confounders are constant over time, the synthetic control method allows for these effects to change over time, by re-weighting the control group so that it has similar pre-intervention characteristics to the treated group.\r\nWe extend the synthetic control approach to a setting of evaluation of a health policy where there are multiple treated units. We re-analyse a recent study evaluating the effects of a hospital P4P scheme on risk-adjusted hospital mortality. In contrast to the original DiD analysis, the synthetic control method reports that, for the incentivised conditions, the P4P scheme did not significantly reduce mortality and that there is a statistically significant increase in mortality for non-incentivised conditions. This result was robust to alternative specifications of the synthetic control method."

      "When lives are put on hold: lengthy asylum processes decrease employment among refugees"
    ],
    "description": [
      "European governments are struggling with the biggest refugee crisis since World War II, but there exists little evidence regarding how the management of the asylum process affects the subsequent integration of refugees in the host country. We provide new causal evidence about how one central policy parameter, the length of time that refugees wait in limbo for a decision on their asylum claim, affects their subsequent economic integration. Exploiting exogenous variation in wait times and registry panel data covering refugees who applied in Switzerland between 1994 and 2004, we find that one additional year of waiting reduces the subsequent employment rate by 4 to 5 percentage points, a 16 to 23% drop compared to the average rate. This deleterious effect is remarkably stable across different subgroups of refugees stratified by gender, origin, age at arrival, and assigned language region, a pattern consistent with the idea that waiting in limbo dampens refugee employment through psychological discouragement, rather than a skill atrophy mechanism. Overall, our results suggest that marginally reducing the asylum waiting period can help reduce public expenditures and unlock the economic potential of refugees by increasing employment among this vulnerable population."

      "How economic, humanitarian, and religious concerns shape European attitudes toward asylum seekers"
    ],
    "description": [
      "What types of asylum seekers are Europeans willing to accept? We conducted a conjoint experiment asking 18,000 eligible voters in 15 European countries to evaluate 180,000 profiles of asylum seekers that randomly varied on nine attributes. Asylum seekers who have higher employability, have more consistent asylum testimonies and severe vulnerabilities, and are Christian rather than Muslim received the greatest public support. These results suggest that public preferences over asylum seekers are shaped by sociotropic evaluations of their potential economic contributions, humanitarian concerns about the deservingness of their claims, and anti-Muslim bias. These preferences are similar across respondents of different ages, education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across the surveyed countries. This public consensus on what types of asylum seekers to accept has important implications for theory and policy."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Crowdfunding is a new business model in which journalists rely\u2014and depend\u2014on (micro-) payments by a large number of supporters to finance their reporting. In this form of entrepreneurial journalism the roles of publisher, fundraiser and journalist often overlap. This raises questions about conflicts of interest, accountability and transparency. The article presents the results of selected case studies in four different European countries\u2014Germany (Krautreporter), Italy (Occhidellaguerra), the United Kingdom (Contributoria) and the Netherlands (De Correspondent)\u2014as well as one US example (Kickstarter). The study used a two-step methodological approach: first a content analysis of the websites and the Twitter accounts with regard to practices of media accountability, transparency and user participation was undertaken. The aim was to investigate how far ethical challenges in crowdfunded entrepreneurial journalism are accounted for. Second, we present findings from semi-structured interviews with journalists from each crowdfunding. The study provides evidence about the ethical issues in this area, particularly in relation to production transparency and responsiveness. The study also shows that in some cases of crowdfunding (platforms), accountability is outsourced and implemented only through the audience participation."

    "description": [
      "Current transformations in the media landscape are challenging contemporary communication and media ethics in at least 2 ways. First, digitization of the media creates new ethical problems that stimulate calls for a redefinition of the norms and values of public communication. Second, new instruments of web-based media observation introduce new possibilities for media (self-)regulation and accountability, thus complementing the initiatives of traditional institutions like press councils. The article retraces those conflicting developments by reference to 2 comparative studies, representing the diverging traditions of conventional communication ethics and media accountability research. In bridging over the conceptual gap between the 2 forms of research, the article develops new perspectives for ethical reflection in the mediatized worlds of the digital age."

    ],
    "description": [
      "For thousands of years philosophers have discussed the question of whether numbers exist. Surprisingly, there are very easy arguments from commonly accepted truths that seem to decide the question. For instance, it is a commonly accepted truth that Obama has two hands. If Obama has two hands, then the number of Obama\u2019s hands is two, and, thus, numbers exist. If such arguments were convincing, ontological disputes about the existence of numbers could be decided simply by pointing to Obama\u2019s hands! The book offers a defense of the profoundness of traditional onto\u00adlogical questions by showing that the easy arguments in question are based on false linguistic assumptions. To do so it engages with recent linguistic research and develops analyses of the pertinent sentences that are of interest far beyond the metaontological question at hand."

      "Cross-scale analysis in classification and segmentation of movement"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Movement is the essence of many spatiotemporal phenomena around us. Recent advances in tracking technologies have enabled the collection of tremendous amounts of movement trajectory data. Following in the footsteps of data production, computational methods are being developed in order to extract meaningful patterns from the raw movement data. These patterns, in return, can be related to valuable information about the behaviors of the moving objects under study. However, due to the internal and external factors influencing movement, the behaviors maybe compounds of different patterns at various spatial and temporal scales.\r\nThe focus of this thesis therefore lies on investigating the importance of scale and cross-scale analysis in two movement analysis tasks, namely movement classification and trajectory segmentation. In movement classification, the aim is to build a classification model by finding relationships and rules among movement features in order to assign the input data to known classes. In trajectory segmentation, however, the aim is to decompose a movement trajectory into segments of homogenous movement characteristics. These characteristics can be measured by different geometrical, physiological or semantic properties of movement. The relevance of these two analysis tasks are highly recognized in the literature, however, the consideration of cross-scale aspects has the advantage to improve the commonly used single-scale approaches in the tasks of movement classification and trajectory segmentation.\r\nThe main contribution of this thesis lies in introducing new methodologies for cross-scale movement analysis. In movement classification, we employed a resampling method for an improvement computation of movement parameters across different temporal scales as input features in the classification. Moreover, the use of discrete wavelet transform (DWT), as another multi-scale measure, is investigated to provide complementary features in movement classification. DWT is further used in trajectory segmentation, where the provided decomposition levels of DWT is used to investigate the variations in movement patterns across different scales.\r\nIn the addressed tasks, this thesis shows that cross-scale analysis is needed in order to define an analysis scale which matches better to the scale of phenomena under study and that employing such methods yields better-quality results compared to single-scale analysis. The importance of cross-scale analysis was revealed by application on various movement datasets in real-world applications such as neuropharmacology, behavioral ecology, and biology."

      "Deriving high resolution 3D information using multibaseline airborne SAR interferometry"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a remote sensing technology that can be used to generate topography measurements such as digital elevation models (DEMs). The measurements are characterized by properties that highly depend on the system parameters. These properties include backscatter characteristics, penetration into vegetation, spatial resolution, geolocation accuracy, vertical noise, and coherence.\r\nInSAR sensors have been used operationally on air- and spaceborne platforms to generate moderate resolution DEMs. They are able to cover large areas with a small number of acquisitions, with independence from weather and daylight conditions. Higher, submeter resolution topography measurements are typically achieved using airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology. While now a mature and widely-used technology, ALS uses narrow swaths for high resolution data acquisitions and therefore requires large numbers of acquisitions. InSAR has the potential of achieving high resolution 3D measurements using the appropriate system parameters, and therefore could combine high resolution data acquisition with a large coverage, reducing costs.\r\nData from an experimental airborne millimeter wave multibaseline InSAR system, the MEMPHIS system, were studied in this work. The datasets yielded decimeter resolution SAR images. The sensor uses the Ka-band wavelength that penetrates only marginally into vegetation, and multiple receiving antennas to combine straightforward phase unwrapping with reduced vertical noise. These unique properties enable the generation of high resolution three dimensional data, with accuracies that approach those of ALS data.\r\nTo fully exploit the provided raw data, they first have to be focused into high resolution SAR images. Subsequent interferometric processing yields the topographic information. The work presented here investigated the prerequisites, such as the required navigation data quality and appropriate SAR focusing algorithms, necessary to generate well-focused images, accurate geo- location, and trustworthy interferometric phase values.\r\nSAR focusing and interferometric processing algorithms able to generate highly accurate point clouds or digital surface models (DSMs) are proposed. First a coarse-to-fine (C2F) interferometric phase estimation method is introduced, where interferograms generated using the shorter base- lines are only used to help unwrap the interferogram generated using the longest available base- line. A maximum likelihood (ML) phase estimation method was also investigated, taking into account information from all receiving antennas to retrieve a better phase estimation. Signatures of corner reflectors were analyzed in the generated SAR images: measured resolutions yielded values close to the theoretical expectations. The planimetric geolocation accuracy was typically better than 0.1 m, validating the SAR system and focusing algorithm. InSAR DSMs were com- pared to ALS-based models to validate their absolute vertical accuracy; in grassland areas, the height difference between the ~2 m-resolution InSAR DSMs and the reference ALS models was typically 0 \u00b1 0.25 m. The performance of the ML phase estimation was compared to results based on the C2F algorithm, with the ML method consistently delivering higher accuracies: the noise level using the ML approach was slightly but steadily lower than the noise level obtained using the C2F method.\r\nThe potential of InSAR-based point clouds is demonstrated in an application: the point cloud of a forest canopy was generated from multi-aspect multibaseline InSAR data and compared to equivalent products generated using ALS and stereo-photogrammetry techniques. Through a seg- mentation of the point cloud, single trees were detected and their position, height, and crown diameter estimated. These estimates were compared to reference forestry data. The InSAR, ALS, and photogrammetry-based point clouds all showed similar geolocation accuracies, with 0.2 \u2013 0.3 m relative shifts. A much more limited penetration into the canopy was observed for both the InSAR and photogrammetry derived point clouds as compared to ALS. Canopy height models agreed very well with each other, with the InSAR height ~1 m lower than those derived from the other point clouds. Most of the large trees were accurately detected, as well as approxi- mately half of the smaller trees, with a localization accuracy typically better than 1 m. Asides from a slight underestimation, the tree heights agreed well with the reference data, and the esti- mation of the crown diameter was accurate in the mean. Results were more accurate for conifers than for broad-leaf trees. All these results are in line with similar studies that tested ALS data. They validate millimeter wave multibaseline InSAR-data as a reliable alternative for forest mon- itoring in comparison to other remote sensing techniques such as ALS and stereo-photogramme- try.\r\nIn the final chapter, a synthesis of the main findings is presented. The successful use of milli- meter wave multibaseline SAR interferometry to carry out reliable and accurate high resolution topography measurements is highlighted, including its application in monitoring forested ecosys- tems. Limitations are identified: they range from motion compensation errors, to hardware-related severe range sidelobes when illuminating targets with intense backscattering, and to limited pen- etration into the forest canopy reducing detection of understory trees. Further improvements to the data processing are suggested: a reduction of the range sidelobes using multi-step adaptive pulse compression, an elaborate sample selection for the phase estimation, and the use of SAR tomography. Finally, several potential applications are proposed, such as monitoring and analysis of man-made objects, land cover classification using a combination of InSAR and polarimetric data, or change detection. In the latter case, the inherent 3D geolocation of the points removes the need for a precise external height model, and shadowed areas can be filtered using a coherence threshold, reducing the number of false alarms. Through its thorough validation, this work paves the way toward a more operational airborne or possibly spaceborne system that could combine high resolution topography measurements with a wide coverage."

      "Cohort Differences in Psychosocial Function over 20 Years: Current Older Adults Feel Less Lonely and Less Dependent on External Circumstances"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Lifespan psychological and life course sociological perspectives indicate that individual development is shaped by social and historical circumstances. Increases in fluid cognitive performance over the last century are well documented and researchers have begun examining historical trends in personality and subjective well-being in old age. Relatively less is known about secular changes in other key components of psychosocial function among older adults.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: In the present study, we examined cohort differences in key components of psychosocial function, including subjective age, control beliefs, and perceived social integration, as indicated by loneliness and availability of very close others.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We compared data obtained 20 years apart in the Berlin Aging Study (in 1990-1993) and the Berlin Aging Study II (in 2013-2014) and identified case-matched cohort groups based on age, gender, cohort-normed education, and marital or partner status (n = 153 in each cohort, mean age = 75 years). In follow-up analyses, we controlled for having lived in former East versus West Germany, physical diseases, cohort-normed household income, cognitive performance, and the presence of a religious affiliation.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Consistently across analyses, we found that, relative to the earlier-born BASE cohort (year of birth: mean = 1916; SD = 3.38 years; range = 1901-1922), participants in the BASE-II sample (year of birth: mean = 1939; SD = 3.22 years; range = 1925-1949) reported lower levels of external control beliefs (d = -1.01) and loneliness (d = -0.63). Cohorts did not differ in subjective age, availability of very close others, and internal control beliefs.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings suggest that some aspects of psychosocial function of older adults have improved across the two recent decades. We discuss the possible role of sociocultural factors that might have led to the observed set of cohort differences."

      "Der massive Landnutzungswandel im Berggebiet besch\u00e4ftigt Forschung und Praxis: Beispielsweise die Abnahme des Bergackerbaus im M\u00fcnstertal um 90 % seit 1990 sowie dessen F\u00f6rderung unter der neuen Schweizer Agrarpolitik seit 2014 oder die prognostizierte Abnahme der Rebfl\u00e4chen im Gebiet des Naturparks Pfyn-Finges um 17-51 % bis 2040 . Beide Untersuchungsgebiete in dieser Arbeit liegen innerhalb der Schweizer Alpen. Es stellt sich die Frage, ob diese Entwicklungen im Konflikt mit Anstrengungen zum Erhalt der Biodiversit\u00e4t, der Landschafts\u00e4sthetik oder auch des sozialen Gef\u00fcges stehen. Um hierzu einen Beitrag zu leisten, erforschten wir Methoden, welche helfen den Landnutzungswandel zu verstehen und zu prognostizieren. Anhand von real existierenden, aktuellen Themen wurde so ein methodischer Beitrag geleistet und gleichzeitig konnten interessante inhaltliche Ergebnisse produziert werden.\r\nIn dieser Arbeit wurden zwei Methoden erforscht, welche diese Entwicklung r\u00e4umlich aufzeigen und prognostizieren sollen. Eine untersuchte Methode war, die Bewirtschafter ihre Einsch\u00e4tzung direkt auf Luftbildern einzeichnen zu lassen (partizipatives Kartieren). Eine zweite basierte auf einer multikriteriellen Analyse mit nicht-lokalen Experten. Diese Methoden sind r\u00e4umlich explizit, zeigen also auf, an welchen Orten sich der Ackerbau, respektive Weinbau ver\u00e4ndern wird. Sowohl im M\u00fcnstertal als auch im Gebiet des Naturparks Pfyn-Finges wurden neben dem partizipativen Kartieren auch Interviews durchgef\u00fchrt und ein Fragebogen verteilt. Damit konnte aufgezeigt werden wo ein Landnutzungswandel zu erwarten ist und wie dieser von den Bauern und Winzern wahrgenommen wird.\r\nDoch k\u00f6nnen die Bewirtschafter den Landnutzungswandel \u00fcberhaupt vorhersagen und wenn ja, mit welcher Genauigkeit? Und wie viele Teilnehmer br\u00e4uchte es f\u00fcr eine solche Vorhersage? Dieser Frage wurde in einer Fallstudie im Val M\u00fcstair nachgegangen. Dabei wurde nicht nur der Zustand unter der neuen Agrarpolitik erfragt, sondern auch wie denn der Zustand 1990 gewesen sei, also zu einer Zeit als es noch deutlich mehr Ackerbau gab. Diese von den Landwirten beigesteuerten Informationen wurden mit einem rekonstruierten Zustand von 1990 , sowie Beobachtungen aus den Jahren 2014 und 2015 verglichen. In der Umfrage wurden jeweils drei Massst\u00e4be (1:5 000, 1:12 5000 und 1:25 000) verwendet.\r\nDie Auswertung der Studie im Val M\u00fcstair zeigte, dass die Bewirtschafter den historischen Zustand genauer und kompletter als die Prognose einzeichnen konnten. Auch zeigte sich, dass dies auf der Skala mit dem gr\u00f6ssten Detaillierungsgrad am besten ging. Durch die statistische Methode des Jackknifing konnte herausgefunden werden, mit wie vielen Teilnehmern im Durchschnitt ein \u00e4hnliches Resultat wie dasjenige der ganzen Gruppe erreicht worden w\u00e4re. Es zeigte sich, dass f\u00fcr die Erfassung des Zustands im Jahr 1990 auf der detailreichsten Skala 5 der 15 Landwirte und f\u00fcr die Prognose 9 der 15 Teilnehmer ausgereicht h\u00e4tten. Auf der gr\u00f6bsten Skala h\u00e4tte man hingegen 7 und 11 Teilnehmer f\u00fcr den historischen, respektive den prognostischen Zustand, gebraucht. Demnach ben\u00f6tigen detailliertere Skalen weniger Teilnehmer f\u00fcr dieselbe Datenqualit\u00e4t und diese f\u00e4llt gr\u00f6sser aus bei einem vergangenen Zustand als bei einer Prognose.\r\nAber w\u00e4re es nicht glaubw\u00fcrdiger und genauer, man w\u00fcrde die Landschaftsentwicklung mit einem Modell vorhersagen? Die Fallstudie Pfyn-Finges diente der Beanwortung dieser Frage. Es wurden einerseits 33 Winzer mit der Methode der partizipativen Kartierung befragt und andererseits wurde mit 13 nicht lokalen Experten ein multikriterielles Modell erstellt. F\u00fcr die Befragung wurden den Winzern folgende zwei Fragen gestellt: Erstens, welche Fl\u00e4chen werden in 25 Jahren nicht mehr Weinreben sein und zweitens, welche Fl\u00e4chen werden sicher noch Weinreben sein? Die Differenz dieser Meinungen ergab dann die Prognose. F\u00fcr das multikriterielle Modell wurden Experten aus Forschung, Verwaltung und Privatwirtschaft gebeten, die wichtigsten Einflussfaktoren f\u00fcr die Umnutzung von Rebparzellen einzusch\u00e4tzen. Diese Informationen wurden danach in einem Computerprogramm zusammengef\u00fchrt und es wurde berechnet, mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Fl\u00e4che in25 Jahren noch weiter bewirtschaftet wird. 25 Jahre entspricht dabei ungef\u00e4hr der Generation eines Rebstockes: Innerhalb von 25 Jahren wird eine Rebfl\u00e4che also neu bepflanzt, was meist eine wichtige Entscheidung darstellt, da diese mit hohen Kosten verbunden ist.\r\nEs zeigte sich, dass es Regionen gibt, in welchen sowohl das partizipative Kartieren als auch das multikriterielle Modell zu \u00e4hnlichen Ergebnissen kommen. Im Bereich des extrapolierten Trends zur Abnahme der Rebfl\u00e4che (ca.17-50 % Abnahme), stimmen die beiden Methoden deutlich besser \u00fcberein, als dies nach Zufall zu erwarten gewesen w\u00e4re. In einem Evaluations-Workshop attestierten die Winzer und die nicht-lokalen Experten der multikriteriellen Analyse eine bessere r\u00e4umliche Aufl\u00f6sung, der kartenbasierten Befragung hingegen eine h\u00f6here Plausibilit\u00e4t. Beide Methoden schnitten aber deutlich besser als ein Zufallsmodell ab und sind somit f\u00fcr Prognosen der Landschaftsentwicklung geeignet. Diese Ergebnisse wurden zus\u00e4tzlich mit Interviewdaten kombiniert und es zeigte sich, dass gewisse Weinberge m\u00f6glicherweise umgenutzt werden, welche von den Winzern einen grossen kulturellen Wert zugeschrieben bekamen."

      "Representing tradition: an analysis of Tu Weiming\u2019s Confucianism"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This paper begins by rehearsing a debate, which took place in the 1980s in the journal Philosophy East and West on whether Mencius was a true successor to Confucius, which has recently prompted a new debate on the topic of tradition and true succession in social epistemology. Rejecting the understanding of tradition in this latter debate as often aloof from the world and as of limited use for the investigation of concrete cases, I turn to the Confucian tradition and to Tu Weiming as one of its current representatives. My interest lies in the ways Tu represents and reconstructs the Confucian tradition and I intend to offer analyses based on two sets of selected English writings asking questions such as: Which textual references does Tu explicitly or only implicitly foreground as crucial to his understanding of the tradition that he is taken to represent? What vocabulary does he use to articulate the contents of the tradition? The paper ends with some thoughts on the question of true succession in Confucianism, stressing the importance of domains of representation and the addressed audiences, in an attempt to enrich the mentioned debates in current social epistemology"

      "Ideas of justice and reconstructions of Confucian justice"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Confucianism tends to play only a marginal role in current theorizing about justice, which is a global pursuit dominated by Western theory and its strong tendency to assume that justice refers to some substantive conception of distributive, socioeconomic justice. This article examines and compares reconstructions of Confucian justice by Joseph Chan, May Sim, and Fan Ruiping. Each reconstruction makes reference to both classical and modern Western justice theory and thus each involves a comparative approach; indeed, each reconstruction seeks ultimately, in its own distinctive fashion, to present a version of Confucian justice that is comparable with modern Western justice theory. In this article we assess, critically and comparatively, the tertium comparationis and the arguments in each reconstruction. While our analysis does not wholly endorse any of the reconstructions, it shows that there is a richness and vitality to Confucian justice theory that merits proper consideration in justice theory conceived as a truly global and cosmopolitan discipline."

It starts by distinguishing different ways in which propositions can be basic or fundamental and by arguing that the foundational status of hinge propositions cannot be reduced to any of the others. The second part maintains that hinges have anti-sceptical potential, provided that one combines Wittgenstein\u2019s critique of sense with Moore\u2019s method of differential certainty. The final part briefly considers implications of the idea of hinge propositions for two debates in which they have not featured so far\u2014once concerning peer disagreement, the other the role of intuitions in philosophy"

      "The emergence of authentic products: The transformation of wine journalism in Germany, 1947\u20132008"
    ],
    "description": [
      "What turns a bottle of fermented grape juice into a cult wine? Current research in the sociology of culture and food assumes that nowadays the distinctiveness of goods is ascertained not on the basis of traditional food hierarchies (e.g. French food and wine as the global benchmark) but based on criteria of authenticity and exoticism. Since public discourse plays an important role in the consecration of aesthetic goods, we study wine journalism in Germany over time. This enables us to analyse the replacement of traditional criteria and the emergence of new criteria of aesthetic valuation in the wine world. The study is based on a systematic content analysis of the two most important German weeklies from 1947 to 2008. We can show that wine reporting shifts dramatically from an orientation towards French and domestic wines and a rather business-like approach to wine towards a more global orientation and a discourse of authenticity focusing on artisanal production, natural conditions of production and the winemaker as an individual personality/artist."

      "Success factors of media product brands. Examining the building blocks for success across different media types"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Media companies and their managers have to develop and adapt products and services as well as processes and business models to exploit opportunities in the digital era. In doing so, knowledge of success factors is crucial.\r\nSuccess factor research in the media is a fairly broad and fragmented field. Studies till date have focused on single types of media; however, this technology-based distinction is no longer valid. It has been shown that products and services converge as well as their development and production processes. Therefore, the present study aims to synthesize the findings from different media contexts.\r\nOn the basis of a comprehensive literature review and semi-structured, in-depth interviews with media professionals from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, ten building blocks of media success are suggested: content, design, environmental orientation, internal processes, organizational aspects, leadership, human resources, marketing, distribution, and external evaluation. The findings support the transferability of success factors on an abstract level and their adaptability for different contexts. They function as hygiene factors representing industry standards and constraints to failure. This study concludes with presenting the implications for media management research and media practice."

    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Pyogenic tonsillitis may often be observed in the general Western population. In severe cases, it may require antibiotic treatment or even hospitalization and often a prompt clinical response will be noted. Here we present an unusual case of progressive multiple organ failure including fulminant liver failure following acute tonsillitis initially mistaken for \"classic\" pyogenic (that is bacterial) tonsillitis.\r\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old previously healthy white man was referred with suspicion of pyogenic angina. After tonsillectomy, he developed acute liver failure and consecutive multiple organ failure including acute hemodynamic, pulmonary and dialysis-dependent renal failure. Immunohistopathological analysis of his tonsils and liver as well as serum polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed herpes simplex virus-2 to be the causative pathogen. Treatment included high-dose acyclovir and multiorgan supportive intensive care therapy. His final outcome was favorable.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Fulminant herpes simplex virus-2-induced multiple organ failure is rarely observed in the Western hemisphere and should be considered a potential diagnosis in patients with tonsillitis and multiple organ failure including acute liver failure. From a clinical perspective, it seems important to note that fulminant herpes simplex virus-2 infection may masquerade as \"routine\" bacterial severe sepsis/septic shock. This persevering condition should be diagnosed early and treated goal-oriented in order to gain control of this life-threatening condition."

      "Impact of a communication strategy on family satisfaction in the intensive care unit"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Family satisfaction of critically ill patients has gained increased interest as important indicator to evaluate the quality of care in the intensive care unit (ICU). The family satisfaction in the ICU questionnaire (FS-ICU 24) is a well-established tool to assess satisfaction in such settings. We tested the hypothesis that an intervention, aiming at improved communication between health professionals and patients' next of kin in the ICU improves family satisfaction, as assessed by FS-ICU 24.\r\nMETHODS: Using a multicenter before-and-after study design, we evaluated medium-term effectiveness of VALUE, a recently proposed strategy aiming at improved communication. Satisfaction was assessed using the FS-ICU 24 questionnaire. Performance-importance plots were generated in order to identify items highly correlated with overall satisfaction but with low individual score.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 163 completed family questionnaires in the pre-intervention and 118 in the post-intervention period were analyzed. Following the intervention, we observed: (1) a non-significant increase in family satisfaction summary score and sub-scores; (2) no decline in any individual family satisfaction item, and (3) improvement in items with high overall impact on satisfaction but quoted with low degree of satisfaction.\r\nCONCLUSION: No significant improvement in family satisfaction of critically ill adult patients could be found after implementing the VALUE strategy. Whether these results are due to insufficient training of the new strategy or a missing effect of the strategy in our socio-economic environment remains to be shown."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article analyzes the relationship between clientelism and citizens' political orientation in Latin America. Consistent political perceptions in the citizenry are central in traditional theories of political competition. This article argues that clientelism hinders the development of consistent political orientation by reducing the utility of information cues, such as left-right labels. More specifically, clientelistic parties generate indifference among their supporters toward the left-right divide by offering them an alternative voting rationale, and increase uncertainty in the political realm by making left-right labels less meaningful. Both arguments are tested with multilevel regression analyses using cross-sectional data covering 18 Latin American countries. The results indicate that clientelistic party supporters are more likely to show indifference toward the left-right dimension and, to a lesser extent, that their left-right orientation corresponds less with their political attitudes."

      "Cognitive Aging in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: Within-Person Associations of Primary Mental Abilities with Psychomotor Speed and Cognitive Flexibility"
    ],
    "description": [
      "It has long been proposed that cognitive aging in fluid abilities is driven by age-related declines of processing speed. Although study of between-person associations generally supports this view, accumulating longitudinal between-person and within-person evidence indicates less strong associations between speed and fluid cognitive performance. Initial evidence also suggests that cognitive flexibility may explain within-person variability in cognitive performance. In the present study, we used up to nine waves of data over 56 years from a subsample of 582 participants of the Seattle Longitudinal Study to examine (a) within-person associations of psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility with cognitive aging in primary mental abilities (including inductive reasoning, number ability, verbal meaning, spatial orientation, and word fluency); and (b) how these within-person associations change with age. In line with the processing speed theory, results revealed that within persons, primary mental abilities (including fluid, crystallized, and visualization measures) were indeed associated with psychomotor speed. We also observed age-related increases in within-person couplings between primary mental abilities and psychomotor speed. While the processing speed theory focuses primarily on associations with fluid abilities, age-related increases in coupling were found for a variety of ability domains. Within-person associations between primary mental abilities and cognitive flexibility were weaker and relatively stable with age. We discuss the role of speed and flexibility for cognitive aging."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Since the programmatic Rosenhan study, there is a broad discussion of how to actively construct clinical realities on both \"insane\" and \"sane\" perspectives. To inform patients about the output of the psychometric questionnaires assessed at intake is a required task in many clinical routines. Information processing bias toward psychopathology may impact many clinical communications and thus lead to clinical errors. Based on an output of the commonly used Symptom Check List 90, case examples demonstrate various grades of balanced and unbalanced alternatives of how to consider the psychopathological as well as the unproblematic poles of Likert scales in discussing psychometric questionnaires at Session 1. We provide one clinical error related to client information at intake assessments and offer four therapeutic tasks that can serve as observable quality indicators of how to facilitate a balanced picture of the patients' burdens and capabilities: (1) validate individual problems, (2) isolate individual problems, (3) validate individual strengths, and (4) break through black and white thinking."

Even though there is an extensive literature on the association between therapy-related cognitions such as irrational beliefs and psychological distress over the past 60 years, there is little meta-analytical knowledge about the nature of this association.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: The relationship between irrational beliefs and distress was examined based on a systematic review that included 100 independent samples, gathered in 83 primary studies, using a random-effect model. The overall effects as well as potential moderators were examined: (a) distress measure, (b) irrational belief measure, (c) irrational belief type, (d) method of assessment of distress, (e) nature of irrational beliefs, (f) time lag between irrational beliefs and distress assessment, (g) nature of stressful events, (h) sample characteristics (i.e. age, gender, income, and educational, marital, occupational and clinical status), (i) developer/validator status of the author(s), and (k) publication year and country.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Overall, irrational beliefs were positively associated with various types of distress, such as general distress, anxiety, depression, anger, and guilt (omnibus: r = 0.38). The following variables were significant moderators of the relationship between the intensity of irrational beliefs and the level of distress: irrational belief measure and type, stressful event, age, educational and clinical status, and developer/validator status of the author.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Irrational beliefs and distress are moderately connected to each other; this relationship remains significant even after controlling for several potential covariates"

    "description": [
      "Although patients\u2019 expectation about a treatment\u2019s efficacy correlate with beneficial therapy processes and outcomes, scant research addresses patients\u2019 expectation for lasting improvement at treatment\u2019s end. Given the influence of beliefs on psychological functioning, posttreatment outcome expectation reflects an important acute treatment outcome. In this study, we examined patient characteristics, treatment processes and clinical change factors in relation to the posttreatment outcome expectation of 65 depressed outpatients completing group cognitive-behavioural therapy. Less than 1% of variability in posttreatment outcome expectation was due to group effects; thus, we conducted single-level regressions. Patients with less severe baseline depression, higher session 3 outcome expectation, more during-treatment hope and a greater reduction in interpersonal problems reported greater posttreatment outcome expectancy. Various patient characteristics and change factors can help clinicians forecast, and respond to, those patients who will possess stronger or weaker belief in their ability to maintain therapy gains at treatment\u2019s end."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Recent efforts have aimed to characterize clinical pediatric populations by using neurophysiological tests in addition to behavioral assays. Here we report on a data collection effort in which electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in both juveniles and adults (N=114 participants, ages 6-44 years of age) during various stimulation protocols. The present analysis focuses on how neural responses during passive viewing of naturalistic videos vary with age and sex, and in particular, how similar they are within developmental groups. Similarity of neural responses was measured as the inter-subject correlation of the EEG. Stimulus-evoked neural responses are more similar among children and decrease in similarity with age. Among children, males respond more similarly to each other than females. This was uniformly true for a variety of videos. The decrease in group similarity with age may result from an overall decline in the magnitude of evoked responses, but this cannot explain the sex differences found in the young. We therefore propose that as children mature, neural function may become more variable."

      "Developmental timing of suicide attempts and cardiovascular risk during young adulthood"
    ],
    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVE: Self-control/self-regulation has received increased attention in health research. Suicide attempts index severe dysregulation in emotional, behavioral, and/or physiological domains. The current study tested whether own and/or others' suicide attempts during the early life course predicted cardiovascular risk by young adulthood and whether developmental timing of suicide attempts, sex of the person, and source of suicide attempts exposure modified these associations.\r\n\r\nMETHOD: Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). At each assessment during Waves I-IV (covering approximately ages 12-32 years), participants reported whether they and/or a friend/family member had attempted suicide. At Wave IV, trained interviewers assessed participants' obesity and hypertension and collected bloodspots from which high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assayed. Sample sizes in the present analyses ranged from n = 7,884 to n = 8,474.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Exposure to own and others' suicide attempts during adolescence was relatively common. In males, suicide attempts during adolescence (\u223cage 15 years) were associated with hypertension and elevated inflammation more than 1 decade later. Associations among suicide attempts by others and cardiovascular risk also emerged.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Exposure to one's own or others' severe dysregulation in the form of suicide attempts during the early life course signals risk for cardiovascular health problems by the late twenties. Adolescent males who attempted suicide and individuals exposed to suicide attempts in their social network may benefit from a dual focus on mental and physical health in care.

      "Rationale, design and methods for the RIGHT Track Health Study: pathways from childhood self-regulation to cardiovascular risk in adolescence"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors during adolescence-including obesity, elevated lipids, altered glucose metabolism, hypertension, and elevated low-grade inflammation-is cause for serious concern and potentially impacts subsequent morbidity and mortality. Despite the importance of these cardiovascular risk factors, very little is known about their developmental origins in childhood. In addition, since adolescence is a time when individuals are navigating major life changes and gaining increasing autonomy from their parents or parental figures, it is a period when control over their own health behaviors (e.g. drug use, sleep, nutrition) also increases. The primary aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods for the RIGHT Track Health Study. This study examines self-regulation as a key factor in the development of cardiovascular risk, and further explores health behaviors as an explanatory mechanism of this association. We also examine potential moderators (e.g. psychosocial adversities such as harsh parenting) of this association.\r\n\r\nMETHOD/DESIGN: RIGHT Track is a longitudinal study that investigates social and emotional development. The RIGHT Track Health Study prospectively follows participants from age 2 through young adulthood in an effort to understand how self-regulatory behavior throughout childhood alters the trajectories of various cardiovascular risk factors during late adolescence via health behaviors. Individuals from RIGHT Track were re-contacted and invited to participate in adolescent data collection (~16.5, 17.5 and 18(+) years old). Individuals completed assessments of body composition, anthropometric indicators, fitness testing (via peak oxygen consumption), heart rate variability during orthostatic challenge, 7-day accelerometry for physical activity and sleep, 24-h dietary recalls, and blood analysis for biomarkers related to metabolic syndrome, inflammatory status and various hormones and cytokines. Individuals also completed extensive self-report measures on diet and eating regulation, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, sleep, substance use, medical history, medication use and a laboratory-day checklist, which chronicled previous day activities and menstrual information for female participants.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Insights emerging from this analysis can help researchers and public health policy administrators target intervention efforts in early childhood, when preventing chronic disease is most cost-effective and behavior is more malleable."

    ],
    "description": [
      "OBJECTIVE: In middle-aged and older samples, perceived subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) is a marker of social rank that is associated with elevated inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk independent of objective indicators of SES (oSES). Whether SSS is uniquely associated with elevated inflammation during young adulthood and whether these linkages differ by sex have not been studied using a nationally representative sample of young adults.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. At Wave IV, young adults aged mostly 24 to 32 years reported their SSS, oSES, and a range of covariates of both SES and elevated inflammation. Trained fieldworkers assessed medication use, body mass index, and waist circumference, and also collected bloodspots from which high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assayed. The sample size for the present analyses was n = 13,236.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Descriptive and bivariate analyses revealed a graded association between SSS and hs-CRP (b = -0.072, standard error [SE] = 0.011, p < .001): as SSS declined, mean levels of hs-CRP increased. When oSES indicators were taken into account, this association was no longer significant in women (b = -0.013, SE = 0.019, p = .514). In men, a small but significant SSS-hs-CRP association remained after adjusting for oSES indicators and additional potential confounders of this association in the final models (b = -0.034, SE = 0.011 p = .003; p < .001 for the sex by SSS interaction).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: SSS is independently associated with elevated inflammation in young adults. The associations were stronger in men than in women. These data suggest that subjective, global assessments of social rank might play a role in developing adverse health outcomes."

    ],
    "description": [
      "Person-environment fit has been identified as a key prerequisite for employee well-being. We investigated to what extent a misfit between motivational needs and supplies at the workplace affects two key health outcomes: burnout and physical symptoms. Individual needs (implicit affiliation and power motives) and environment supplies (motive specific job characteristics) were assessed in an online survey of full time employees (n = 97), using a picture story exercise measuring implicit motives and a scale listing affiliation and power related job characteristics. Outcomes were assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a checklist of physical symptoms. We conducted polynomial regressions with response surface analysis. Results reveal that motivational incongruence with respect to the affiliation motive was related to high job burnout, while motivational incongruence concerning the power motive predicted increased physical symptoms. This was true for both those with a strong affiliation or power motive and low corresponding job characteristics and those with a weak affiliation or power motive and job characteristics demanding the respective motive. Results hint at potential interventions toward preventing or remedying a lack of needs-supply fit and reducing the risk of impairments of well-being."

      "An overview of glacier lakes in the Western Italian Alps from 1927 to 2014 based on multiple data sources (historical maps, orthophotos and reports of the glaciological surveys)"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1850 AD) a general and progressive retreat of glaciers started in the European Alps, causing important environmental changes in this high mountain region. The appearance of glacier lakes is one of the most evident environmental effects in the Alps as well as in newly deglaciated areas worldwide. In order to understand conditions of formation and reconstruct evolutionary stages of glacier lakes, it is important to collect and analyse a diversity of data from different time periods. Through the analysis of historical topographic maps and digital orthophotos, we identified and digitalized in a GIS environment glacier lakes (and related features) of the Western Italian Alps (Piemonte and Aosta Valley regions) within the LIA maximum extent boundaries. We produced six glacier lake inventories related to six different time steps: 1930s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2006-07 and 2012. We provided a general overview of the main morphometric, geomorphologic and geographic features of lakes of each time step and preliminary considerations on changes in the number of lakes within the considered time period. The most detailed analysis has been performed over the 2006-07 time step: 214 detected lakes, covering a total area of about 146 (\u00b11) \u00b7 104 m2, 3/4 of the lakes measuring less than 6000 m2 as individual area and a half of the total number less than 2000 m2. The mean elevation of lakes was 2776 m a.s.l., 72% being located between 2600 and 3000 m. In general, lakes are localized mainly in the Graian Alps (Rutor-Lechaud, Gran Sassiere-Tsanteleina and Gran Paradiso chains) and in the Pennine Alps (Monte Rosa Group). Moreover, in a dedicated database, we collected information (descriptions, photos, maps) about glacier lakes from the reports of the annual glaciological surveys published by the Italian Glaciological Committee (CGI) since 1928. Finally, we reported two cases of glacier lakes at the Tz\u00e9re Glacier (Monte Rosa Group, Pennine Alps) and at the Ban Glacier (Monte Leone-Blinnenhorn Chain, Lepontine Alps), in order to demonstrate the importance of integrating data from a diversity of sources (historical maps, orthophotos and reports of the glaciological surveys) for better detailed reconstructions of the condition of formation, evolutionary stages and process dynamics of the lake. Results of the present research can contribute to reconstruct and to interpret the spatiotemporal evolution of the phenomenon and to improve the knowledge about the interactions between glacier and related glacier lakes."

      "Common But Differentiated Responsibilities Beyond the Nation State: how Is Differential Treatment Addressed in Transnational Climate Governance Initiatives?"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Many multilateral environmental agreements have adopted differentiated rules for different countries, based on the recognition of the \u2018common but differentiated responsibilities\u2019 (CBDRs) of states. By establishing two rigid groups of countries with and without emissions reduction obligations, the intergovernmental climate regime represents the most extreme case of such differentiation. The regime has struggled to overcome this rigidity and the resulting political deadlock between developing and developed countries. Transnational climate governance (TCG) initiatives have emerged as an alternative to provide mitigation, adaptation or finance outside the multilateral process. By drawing on synergies between public and private actors, it is hoped that they overcome the paralysis of the intergovernmental process. Yet, they take place in the same world of unequal peers, with different levels of capacity and responsibility for climate change. This article investigates the extent to which such TCG initiatives reflect the CBDR principle. Do different types of initiative \u2013 involving different types of actor or with different climate-related goals \u2013 address differentiation in distinct ways? Does taking account of CBDRs affect the membership of transnational initiatives? This article explores these questions empirically by analyzing a sample of TCG initiatives in terms of how they include differential treatment of states and non-state members. It concludes that TCG initiatives address differentiation in a pragmatic way. Most frequently, they either offer participants flexibility in how to implement their commitments, or provide support to members from developing countries. Such support is, so far, still insufficient to address the limited involvement of developing country actors."

      "Mindfulness Promotes the Ability to Deliver Performance in Highly Demanding Situations"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Trait mindfulness helps people handle distress and improves their satisfaction with life. The aim of the present paper is to examine whether trait mindfulness also promotes positive functioning (i.e., performance) in highly demanding situations, such as in elite sports. Mindfulness has been shown to improve athletes\u2019 ability to perform well, i.e., to increase their performance-delivery. However, researchers are still speculating about the underlying mechanism. The present research examines whether trait mindfulness enhances the ability of elite athletes to trigger performance in demanding situations by generally reducing competition anxiety and diminishing its negative impact when it occurs. Participants were 133 elite athletes from 23 different sports. They completed measures of trait mindfulness, competition anxiety, and performance-delivery. Mediation, moderation, and moderated-mediation effects of mindfulness and competition anxiety on performance-delivery were tested. Our findings indicate that trait mindfulness is related to fewer performance worries and prevents the remaining worries from influencing athletes\u2019 behavior, thereby helping them to perform better. Implications and directions for further research are discussed. Apart from benefits for psychological health, instructing people to become more mindful might be a promising approach to help them optimize their performance in demanding situations."

      "Estimation of individual redirected walking thresholds using standard perception tests"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Redirected walking (RDW) allows users to interact with a Virtual Environment (VE) much larger than the real space. However, there is a limit to how much a user can be redirected such that immersion in the VE is still preserved. While much effort has been spent on identifying this limit, so-called redirected walking thresholds, these thresholds are more a general guideline than being personalized for each user. Since individuals' differences in perception play an important role in users's experience in a redirected VE, there is potential to optimize the thresholds using these differences.\r\nIn this paper, we propose an investigation on the relationship between redirected walking thresholds (RDTs) and perception traits such as visual dependency, susceptibility to visual-vestibular conflicts, and sensitivity to internal body changes, which can be measured in postural sway, rod-and-frame, vection and interoception tests. Consequentially, we will investigate the potential of using these tests as tools for the estimation of personalized RDTs."

      "Spot-checks to measure general hygiene practice"
    ],
    "description": [
      "A variety of hygiene behaviors are fundamental to the prevention of diarrhea. We used spot-checks in a survey of 761 households in Burundi to examine whether something we could call general hygiene practice is responsible for more specific hygiene behaviors, ranging from handwashing to sweeping the floor. Using structural equation modeling, we showed that clusters of hygiene behavior, such as primary caregivers' cleanliness and household cleanliness, explained the spot-check findings well. Within our model, general hygiene practice as overall concept explained the more specific clusters of hygiene behavior well. Furthermore, the higher general hygiene practice, the more likely children were to be categorized healthy (r\u00a0=\u00a00.46). General hygiene practice was correlated with commitment to hygiene (r\u00a0=\u00a00.52), indicating a strong association to psychosocial determinants. The results show that different hygiene behaviors co-occur regularly. Using spot-checks, the general hygiene practice of a household can be rated quickly and easily."

      "Aerobic Fitness Level Affects Cardiovascular and Salivary Alpha Amylase Responses to Acute Psychosocial Stress"
    ],
    "description": [
      "BACKGROUND: Good physical fitness seems to help the individual to buffer the potential harmful impact of psychosocial stress on somatic and mental health. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of physical fitness levels on the autonomic nervous system (ANS; i.e. heart rate and salivary alpha amylase) responses to acute psychosocial stress, while controlling for established factors influencing individual stress reactions.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: The Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) was executed with 302 male recruits during their first week of Swiss Army basic training. Heart rate was measured continuously, and salivary alpha amylase was measured twice, before and after the stress intervention. In the same week, all volunteers participated in a physical fitness test and they responded to questionnaires on lifestyle factors and personal traits. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine ANS responses to acute psychosocial stress from physical fitness test performances, controlling for personal traits, behavioural factors, and socioeconomic data.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Multiple linear regression revealed three variables predicting 15\u00a0% of the variance in heart rate response (area under the individual heart rate response curve during TSST-G) and four variables predicting 12\u00a0% of the variance in salivary alpha amylase response (salivary alpha amylase level immediately after the TSST-G) to acute psychosocial stress. A strong performance at the progressive endurance run (high maximal oxygen consumption) was a significant predictor of ANS response in both models: low area under the heart rate response curve during TSST-G as well as low salivary alpha amylase level after TSST-G. Further, high muscle power, non-smoking, high extraversion, and low agreeableness were predictors of a favourable ANS response in either one of the two dependent variables.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Good physical fitness, especially good aerobic endurance capacity, is an important protective factor against health-threatening reactions to acute psychosocial stress."

      "Political and institutional determinants of immigration policies"
    ],
    "description": [
      "This paper investigates how the interplay of parties' preferences, political institutions and electoral competition affects the liberalisation of immigration policies. It joins a growing body of research that focuses on the role of domestic factors in shaping immigration policies. While several studies point to the important role of partisanship and the activation of public opinion, they fail to provide a clear mechanism that takes into account differences in parties' preferences as well as the institutional context they act in. By adding two crucial factors to the analysis, this paper presents a new framework for liberal change in the field of immigration politics. First, institutional veto points determine if left-of-centre parties can reform policies according to their preferences. Second, the degree of electoral competition and the politicisation of immigration issues affect how susceptible political parties are to the anti-immigrant sentiment in the population. A time-series cross-section analysis of 11 countries from 1980 to 2006 shows that left-of-centre governments are more likely to pass liberal reforms, but only if they are not facing an open veto point. Moreover, increased levels of electoral competition coupled with a politicisation of the immigration issue reduces the likelihood of liberal reforms."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article investigates how the degree of electoral competition affects parties\u2019 policy positions. It follows a growing body of research on party positioning in multiparty competition that regards elections as signals for parties that have to choose their positions and issue strategies. In this article we argue that previous elections provide information about the competitiveness of the upcoming election. The expected degree of electoral competition affects parties\u2019 future policy positions since with increasing competitiveness of an election, parties have higher incentives to move toward a vote-maximizing position. However, what constitutes a vote-maximizing strategy varies between parties. While large mainstream parties have an incentive to moderate their positions, small and niche parties choose more extreme positions to distinguish themselves from their mainstream competitors. Applying a novel measure of electoral competitiveness, we find that the degree of electoral competition indeed determines parties\u2019 policy shifts, but that this effect is moderated by party size."

    ],
    "description": [
      "This article investigates the impact of niche party success on the policy agendas of mainstream parties. Following from the expected electoral effects of issue politicization, the success of radical right and green parties will cause different reactions from mainstream parties. While mainstream parties emphasize anti-immigrant positions in response to radical right success, green party success will have the opposite effect for environmental issues. Since green parties constitute issue owners, their success will make established parties de-emphasize the environment. Analyzing time-series cross-section data for sixteen Western European countries from 1980 to 2011, this article empirically establishes that green and radical right parties differ in their effect on mainstream party behavior and that their impact depends on the ideological position and past electoral performance of the mainstream parties."

      "The diffusion of policy frames: evidence from a structural topic model"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Policy diffusion occurs when policies in one unit (e.g., countries, states, cities) are influenced by the prior adoption of policies in other units. Although numerous studies have convincingly documented this phenomenon, they have, with very few exceptions, generally ignored a crucial step in the diffusion process\u2014namely, how policies are framed ahead of their adoption. Policy frames\u2014the discussion of a policy from particular viewpoints\u2014play a crucial role in linking the actions of previous units with the potential actions in other units. In this paper, we identify policy frames and examine their link with prior policy adoptions. We focus on the area of restrictions on smoking in U.S. states. Our analysis draws upon an original dataset of more than four million paragraphs from articles published in 50 American newspapers covering 47 states between 1996 and 2014. We use structural topic models to estimate how smoking bans have been framed and how frames change as a function of policy adoption in other states. We find that, as more neighboring states enact legislation restricting smoking, concerns about the restaurant business decrease; worries about the casino business increase; detailed regulations such as ventilation requirements or separate rooms for smokers are discussed less frequently; voters\u2019 support and involvement in the decision-making process surrounding smoking bans are discussed more frequently; the compatibility of smoking restrictions with individual rights loses salience as a topic; and the passage of legislation is discussed more frequently, while the process by which decisions are made loses salience. These findings establish a foothold for the usefulness of structural topic models and support for the idea that policy frames are an important part of the diffusion process."

    ],
    "description": [
      "The press should ideally be the eyes, ears and voice of the public in any state. However, freedom of the press varies across states and is especially lacking in autocratic ones. This paper asks how the press in autocracies tackles the challenge of reporting on contentious mobilization, i.e. protests events that threaten the very survival of the regime. For this, it relies on count and structural topic models applied to an original dataset of roughly half a million newspaper articles published before and after the events of the Arab Spring (January 2009 \u2013 December 2011), and on new protest event data from the Mass Mobilizations in Autocracies Dataset. We find that both the extent of coverage and its content is influenced by the overall degree of censorship in MENA countries. Moreover, threats to authoritarian regimes, measured both as intensity of domestic protests and intensity of protests across the wider MENA region, also influence the coverage of the issue. We also find that these effects are stronger for state owned newspapers."
